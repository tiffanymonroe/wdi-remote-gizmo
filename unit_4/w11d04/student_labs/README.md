## Angular Notes

### Immediately Invoked Function Expression

> An IIFE protects a moduleâ€™s scope from the environment in which it is placed

[Why use an IIFE?](http://gregfranko.com/blog/i-love-my-iife/)

# Ajax design

We want our website to be 'light' and take advantage of Angular's digest loop. We want to have few AJAX requests.

We can change both the backend and frontend.

How can we consolidate our two AJAX requests for traders and commodities? What can we change on our server?

* would we even want to consolidate AJAX requests?

# DISPLAY A TRADER IN CENTRAL PANEL

<br>

What is a good strategy for getting the trader's data displayed in the second panel?

We want

* Trader's name
* Trader's money
* Trader's commodities
* The quantities of each commodity owned by the trader


Things to think about:

* The server routes to query. There are quite a few options.
* How we can change our server routes to give us what we want
* Convenient and intuitive data structures coming from the server
* Easy to understand code on the frontend

<br>

# ADD COMMODITY TO A TRADER

* How would you go about doing this?

# INCREASE QUANTITY OF COMMODITY?

* How would you go about doing this?
