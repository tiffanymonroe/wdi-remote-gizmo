# RAILS CONTROLLERS

### Lesson Objectives
_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

- Review setting up a Rails project
- Review generating and running migrations
- Use the Faker gem to seed data
- Configure RESTFul routes with the Rails router
- Explain what `rails routes` returns
- Write controller methods for _index_ and _show_

<br>
<hr>

### Setup

**We are going to make an app called `songs_app_api`.**

This will be a single-model app that serves json data for songs.

* Initialize an app called `songs_app_api`

```
rails new songs_app_api --api -d postgresql
```

**Start the server:** 

* Run `rails s` to start the server on port 3000 
* `rails s` is short for `rails server`
* Go to `localhost:3000` in the browser.

We should all get an error in the browser.

```
FATAL: database \"____________\" does not exist
```

JSON response:

[To format JSON nicely, use JSON Formatter Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)


* Quit the server: `ctrl + c`

* Create the database: `rails db:create`

* Run the server again: `rails s`. We should see this:

## Make a Song model

> Our app will serve a JSON catalog of songs

* Generate the migration for the songs table: `rails g migration CreateSongs`

* In the migration file, the song table should have columns for title, artist_name, and artwork (all strings):

```ruby
class CreateSongs < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    create_table :songs do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :artist_name
      t.string :artwork
    end
  end
end
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/Mzz6Lfo.png)

* Run the migration: `rails db:migrate`

* Check `schema.rb`

* Create the model file: `app/models/song.rb`

* Add in the class Song

```
class Song < ApplicationRecord

end
```

## SEED

#### Install Faker
We will seed a little differently this time using a gem called `Faker` to give us a bunch of random results. With `Faker` we won't have to invent any seed data.

* Add `gem faker` to the Gemfile. (It can go anywhere but let's put it around line 15/16)

![](https://i.imgur.com/0P8Z3eB.png)

* Run `bundle` to install all your gems

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZLvXOOc.png)

11:37
#### Use Faker

In `seeds.rb` let's write some Ruby to use the Faker gem in a loop:

```ruby
10.times do
  Song.create(
    title: Faker::Hipster.sentence(3),
    artist_name: Faker::Team.name,
    artwork: Faker::Placeholdit.image("50x50")
  )
end
```

[Faker documentation](https://github.com/stympy/faker)

[What is :: the double colon](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3009477/what-is-rubys-double-colon)

* Run the seed file: `rails db:seed`

* Check in rails console `rails c`:

```ruby
Song.all
```

```ruby
Song.find(1)
```

## ROUTES

#### Establish the routes

Routing works differently in Rails than in Node/Express. There is a separate file that will provide a **convention** for our routes. We can't just make them willy-nilly.

* Open `config/routes.rb`

* If we add the line `resources :songs`, Rails will route to the five JSON RESTFul routes for the resource `songs`.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :songs
end
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/MztPxix.png)

* Run `rails routes`

This will show us the routes that have been baked-in for us:

```
$ rails routes
Prefix Verb   URI Pattern          Controller#Action
 songs GET    /songs(.:format)     songs#index
       POST   /songs(.:format)     songs#create
  song GET    /songs/:id(.:format) songs#show
       PATCH  /songs/:id(.:format) songs#update
       PUT    /songs/:id(.:format) songs#update
       DELETE /songs/:id(.:format) songs#destroy
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/4yARg46.png)

Omitted with `--api` are 'New' and 'Edit'.

11:47
## RAILS ROUTES: What is this stuff?

This is a list of all the routes that Rails knows about given what we put in `config/routes.rb`. We could change that file and `rails routes` would give us different results. For now, this is what we have:

**Let's look at the first line**

Ignore the prefix for now

Verb is `GET` and URI Pattern is `/songs`, so we can assume we have a GET route for songs.

The Controller#Action is `songs#index`. This means that for this route, we will have to make a method called `index` within the controller (coming soon). That method will handle requests to `GET /songs`.

So, for our index route, there will will be uri `/songs` (that has no params or anything) according to the usual RESTFul conventions.

[Explanation of .:format](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20320286) can be ignored.

**Let's look at the other lines**

As for the others, they are the same pattern we have seen for RESTFul routing of create, show, update, and destroy routes.

For **show, update, and destroy**, Rails tells us that the first param will be called `:id`. We don't have a choice what it will be called. But at least `rails routes` tells us what is expected.

# CONTROLLERS

#### Make a controller file

**convention over configuration**

Rails is expecting your controller file to conform to its convention. The convention is model-name _plural_ _underscore_ _controller_.

Put it in the `app/controllers` folder:

`app/controllers/songs_controller.rb`

![](https://i.imgur.com/KBoqaRR.png)


#### Make the controller class

See that `application_controller.rb` file? We want our controller to inherit from that thing.

```ruby
class SongsController < ApplicationController
end
```

# &#x1F449; INDEX

Our controller is going to have a method for each route. If we `rails routes`, what method do we use for an **index route**?

The answer is: `index`.


> songs_controller.rb


```ruby
def index
end
```

This is the same business like when we did this in Express for our index route:

```javascript
router.get('/songs', function(req, res) {

});
```

It's much shorter in Rails.

### `render()` method

To render JSON we use the `render` method and pass it a hash: `render json: some_value`

```ruby
  def index
    render json: "hi"
  end
```

The render method takes a hash. To make more visual sense of this, you could write it this way:

```ruby
  def index
    render( json: "hi" )
  end
```

Or, this way:

```ruby
  def index
    render({ :json => "hi" })
  end
```

Check it out in the browser.

To get our songs data, we could just write raw SQL into the controller:

```ruby
  def index
    render json: ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute('SELECT * FROM songs;')
  end
```

re-factored

```ruby
def index
  query_string = "SELECT * FROM songs;"
  results = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(query_string)
  render json: results
end
```

_But_ what we want is to use the convenient Ruby shorthand provided by ActiveRecord: `Song.all`. The same queries we have been using in rails console.

Putting it together:

```ruby
class SongsController < ApplicationController

  def index
	render json: Song.all
  end

end
```

Checking our `rails routes`, what is the URI for our index route? Let's go to that route in the browser.

```
localhost:3000/songs
```

If all goes according to plan, we have successfully established our API:

![](https://i.imgur.com/7OXzwcU.png)

## Status Codes

If we are going to deliver our API to some end-user, we should provide a **status code**.

Change the code to deliver a 200 OK status code:

```
  def index
    songs = Song.all
    render json: {status: 200, songs: songs}
  end
```

# &#x1F449; SHOW

Looking at `rails routes`, what method do we use for a _show_ route?

The answer is: `show`

Show routes always come with an id attached -- The purpose of a show route it to display one of a given resource, which we get by id.

Looking at `rails routes`, the param will be called `:id`. This is just the first param in the uri. Rails has gone ahead and just named the first param `:id`.

In Express, we got the id through `req.params.id`

In Rails, The URL params are stored in a globally existing **hash** called `params`. We can access params inside the params hash like so:

```
params[:id]
```

What ActiveRecord query could we use to get a particular song using the id?

Answer: `.find()` will do.

```
  def show
    render json: Song.find(params[:id])
  end
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/pOAEnv0.png)

Looking at `rails routes`, what URI do we visit to see the show page?

```
localhost:3000/songs/1
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/hgu8B1p.png)

<br>

## Status Code

Include the status code, `200 OK`

```
  def show
    song = Song.find(params[:id])
    render json: {status: 200, song: song}
  end
```

## Params hash

In Express, the params came through in an **object**, `req.params`.

In Rails, the request object also has params, and those params are also stored as key-value pairs (in a **hash**).

There not much difference.

To see the params, try `puts`ing them in the controller, and seeing the output in Terminal:
