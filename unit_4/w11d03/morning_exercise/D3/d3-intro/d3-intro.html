    <p>Across from where? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. <strong> I hear the jury's still out on science.</strong> <em> What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?</em> " First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.</p>
    <p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Michael!</p>
    <p>I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. I'm afraid I just blue myself. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
    <p>Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Army had half a day. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</p>
    <p>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I care deeply for nature. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"</p>
    <p>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Michael! That's why you always leave a note! We just call it a sausage. I care deeply for nature.</p>
    <p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Steve Holt! Not tricks, Michael, illusions. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked! He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.</p>
