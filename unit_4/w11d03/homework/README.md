# &#x1F3B8; &#x1F3B6; &#x1F3A4; &#x1F469; &#x1F3B9; IT'S THE FINAL HOMEWORK &#x1F3B9; &#x1F3BC; &#x1F3B8; &#x1F3B8;



### RAILS ONE-TO-MANY: PRODUCTS AND REVIEWS APP

![](https://i.imgur.com/YUD0yOM.png)

**A product has many reviews, a review belongs to a product**

### Back End

* Make Rails server work with resource for Products
* Make Reviews resource
* Edit Reviews routes as nested resources
* Make foreign keys and associations
* Routing - use **only** and **except** to filter the routes
* Change the controllers to reflect the changes we have made

### Front End

* Make an Express/Angular frontend that consumes the API
* The user should be able to see all the product images and click on them
* Each product show page should display its associated reviews
* A user of the app should be able to add a review to a product
* A user of the app should be able to update and delete any reviews (chaos)

## SCAFFOLD REVIEWS

Unfortunately there is no official way to do a scaffold with nested resources and associations. There is a gem: [Nested scaffold gem](https://github.com/amatsuda/nested_scaffold). But what we will do is scaffold as usual and then make tweaks to our code. That way we will be able to operate on our code a bit and see how it works.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gYuEXzR.png)

`rails routes` gives us the routes below: **but** we only want reviews to be accessed in relation to a product. Ie. First get a product by its id, then get the relevant review that belongs that product. We don't really want free-floating CRUDdable reviews.
![](https://i.imgur.com/gWFE08E.png)

<br>

## NESTED RESOURCES

So let's change our resources. Nest reviews inside of products:

`config/routes.rb`

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ye7EgeK.png)

When we `rails routes`, we should see:

![](https://i.imgur.com/YhdjQ7H.png)

We can see that in our `reviews` controller the first param will be called `:product_id` and the second param will be called `:id`. We can only ever create or alter a review in relation to a product. This is the restriction we have chosen! No free-floating reviews!

## FOREIGN KEY

Good practice is to add the foreign key with a migration rather than up-front in the scaffold or generator or original migration or what-have-you.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yB82yqp.png)


Open Rails console and test the association.

* `rails c`
* `Product.find(1).reviews`
* **&#x1F47E; Glitch!**

Look at that horrible error. At the top is this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/fpp1B7J.png)

NoMethodError for 'reviews'. We must first add the relations to our models:

![](https://i.imgur.com/WIIMtZ0.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/6uvP9Jv.png)


Try again:

* `Product.find(1).reviews`

Zig-a-zig ahhh:

![](https://i.imgur.com/FaQGTup.png)

It works. There are no reviews yet, but it works.

```
Product.find(1).reviews.create(title: "second review", title: "middling product I'd say", author: "Chingy Right Thurr")

* See Product 1's many Reviews: `Product.find(1).reviews`

* See the Reviews that belong to Product 1: `Review.where(product_id: 1)`

## ROUTES - ONLY AND EXCEPT

**Products:** Currently, we have more routes than we intend or need. We want the users of our API only to be able to see an **index** and **show** of our Products, and not to alter the db.

**Routes:** We will want all the routes for the reviews except for the **show** route. (We won't really ever need to see a review in isolation).

### Product routes: only

Tell the router that for Products we **only** want index and show, and leave out the others:

![](https://i.imgur.com/c1j1NfX.png)

`rails routes`, alot less routes:

![](https://i.imgur.com/0Uw5WH2.png)


### Review routes: except

Tell the router that for Reviews we want everything **except** show:

![](https://i.imgur.com/GbH1qfk.png)

`rails routes`, even less routes:

The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 5: Routes trimmed with only and except".
<hr>
<br>

## CONTROLLERS - PRODUCTS

In the products controller, we'll need to make some changes given that we have changed the routing.

* Delete the methods that alter data: **create**, **update**, **destroy**, and the **product_params**, and `before action` helper.
* Change the `show` action to `.find` the Product
* Add status codes (either render status codes or send them through as json)

Complete Products controller with rendered status codes:

&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 6: Products controller fixed".
<hr>
<br>

## CONTROLLERS - REVIEWS

* Delete the show method, and the show argument to `before action`.

Remember, since our Reviews routes are nested inside Products, example (Reviews index)...

```
/products/:product_id/reviews
```

... we will have to adjust each of our methods to reflect the **params hash**.

If we `rails routes`, remember, the URI for our reviews always has a param for a product id.
In each of our routes, we will have to query for our reviews by whatever number is stored in that param.


### Reviews Index

We have a number coming through in `:product_id`: We _could_ query for a Product with that number and then ask for the reviews like so:

Reviews controller:

```
  def index
    product = Product.find(params[:product_id])

    render json: product.reviews
  end
```

See how that could work?

But there is a better way that makes more semantic sense.

* Since we are in the Reviews controller lets find Reviews instead of Products
* Since there is a param called `:product_id` let's match it to a column called `product_id`.

Answer:

```
  def index
    reviews = Review.where(product_id: params[:product_id])

    render json: reviews
  end
```

Check out the reviews for Product 1 in the browser, `/products/1/reviews`:

The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 7: Reviews index method fixed".
<hr>
<br>


### Reviews Create

Create the review as usual.

We can set its `product_id` column to the `:product_id` param from the **params hash**. Voil√†.

Remove `location: @review` because we don't need or want a URL redirect.

Test Review Create with Postman:

The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 7: Reviews create method fixed".
<hr>
<br>


## Reviews Update and Destroy

Turns out we don't need a `product_id` to reference which review to update or destroy. Just update it or destroy it by id.

> We would need the product_id in the update route only if we were going to _change which product_ the review belongs to. We are not going to do that . . .

In our routes, we can remove update and destroy from the nested routes, and give them their own domain:

![](https://i.imgur.com/dNIPgup.png)

`:update` and `:destroy` removed from nested resources.

Reviews resources gets `:update` and `:destroy` on its own.

`rails routes` gives us some modified routes:

![](https://i.imgur.com/wAUWn0A.png)

Correspondingly, we don't need to alter either the update or delete methods in the Reviews controller.

**Test your routes with Postman**

# HUNGRY FOR MORE?


## Configure CORS

Make it so a frontend app running on a local port can access your API

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 9: Configured CORS".
<hr>
<br>

## Front End

Make it so an Express project using some kind of frontend framework or library, which could be

* jQuery
* Angular
* Other

can make an AJAX request to the Products index.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 10: AJAX request to Products Index".
<hr>
<br>


## Display Product images and reviews

Make it so your frontend app will display all the Product images.

When the user **clicks on an image**, they will be shown all the Reviews associated with that Product. You will need to make an AJAX request to the reviews index.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 11: AJAX request to Reviews Index".
<hr>

## Write a Review

Make it so a user of your frontend app can write a review of a particular Product

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 12: AJAX request to Reviews Create".
<hr>
<br>

## Update a Review

Make it so a user of your frontend app can edit a review of a particular Product

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>

<br>

# HUNGRY FOR EVEN MORE?

## Make an 'admin' app

The admin app should be able to create, edit, and delete Products from the database. On the Rails server, you will need to:

* Configure CORS to allow only the admin app db privileges for Products
* Alter the routes and controller for Products

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 15: The Void".
