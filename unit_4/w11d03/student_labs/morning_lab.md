* **PLAN A BACKEND API THAT HAS A ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP**

### DATA-MODELING AND DESIGNING AN API

Your boss wants you to design and build an API. The API is going to deliver some data about the **average share prices** for saleable **stocks** on the stock market. 

You know you will be dealing with **average prices** and **stocks**, and that the two things are related.

Answer the following questions:

<br>

* What **models** will you need? Why?

<br>

* What is the relation between **average prices** and **stocks**?
* What **columns** would you want for your tables?
* Does one of your tables get a **foreign key** column? If so, which?

<br>

* What **controllers** will you need?
* What **routes** do you want your API to have?
* Do you want nested routes?
* What **actions** will your controller need, given your routes?

<br>

* Can you make your API 'self-evident'? Meaning, your API requires little explanation for an end-user?

<br>

**When you think you know the answers to these questions, build your API.**
