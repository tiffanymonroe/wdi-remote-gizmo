## Ruby

Ruby is a language of created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto who blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language.

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/

## Setup
1. Create a file called `ruby_practice.rb` inside your `student_examples` folder. You can use this file to practice your ruby code.
2. When you want to run your code, in the terminal, use the word `ruby` in front of your file name to see the output.

## Ruby Basic Syntax

- We **don not** end statements with semi-colons `;`

- Single line comments are created with `#`. You can still highlight code and use `command` + `/` to comment out lines.

- We don't need the keyword `var` anymore
```ruby
#JavaScript
var greeting = "hello";

#Ruby
greeting = hello
```

- most variables use `snake_case` naming conventions

```ruby
long_variable_name = 1
```

## Working with the terminal

- Functions in ruby don't need parentheses

- The equivalent of Javascript's console.log() is Ruby's `puts`.

- `puts` can be written out as `puts` or referenced by the shorthand of `p`

- to run the code from your file in your terminal, use the command `ruby` and the filename.

```javascript
//JavaScript
console.log('hi');
```
```ruby
#Ruby
puts 'hi'

#or

p 'hi'
```

### Practice
1. Print "Hello World" to the terminal.

<hr>

## Input
- We can retrieve values from user input using `gets`. When Ruby executes a line of code with a `gets`, it will wait for input before it moves on executing other lines.

```ruby
puts "What is your age?"
user_input = gets
puts user_input
```

Note: This will return a string with an extra line. To remove the extra line from the input, use `.chomp` at the end of your variable.
`puts user_input.chomp`

```ruby
puts "What is your age?"
user_input = gets
puts user_input.chomp
```

### Practice
1. Ask for a user's name and save it to a variable.
2. Print out the name to the console.

<hr>

## Simple Objects & Built-in Methods

Everything that can be manipulated in a Ruby program is an object. Let's explore the "simple objects":

### Strings

##### Both single and double quotes can be used for strings (just like JavaScript)
```ruby
#double quotes
puts "Ruby"
```

```ruby
#single quotes
puts 'Python'
```
### Built-in Methods

##### Length of a string
```ruby
puts "Ruby".size

#=> 4
```

##### Uppercase a string
```ruby
puts "Ruby".upcase

#=> RUBY
```

##### Capitalize the first letter of a string
```ruby
puts "ruby".capitalize

#=> Ruby
```

##### Convert a number to a string
```ruby
p 23.to_s

#=> "23"
```

### Practice
1. Show the output of a string of your choosing.
2. Find the length of your first name using Ruby's built-in `.size` method.
3. Show the output of the word 'washington' with all uppercased letters.
4. Show the output of the word 'washington' to have a capitalized `W`.
5. Convert the number `99` to a string.

<hr>

##### String interpolation
```ruby
foo = "bar"
puts "oh hai #{foo}" #string interpolation

#=> oh hai bar
```
NOTE: string interpolation doesn't work with single quotes

```ruby
# This will NOT work. It will return the literal string written between the quotes.
puts 'oh hai #{foo}'

#=> oh hai #{foo}
```

###### String interpolation: multi-line strings use a different syntax
```ruby
long_string = <<-ENDOFLINE
This is the first line
and the second one
here comes third
and fourth
ENDOFLINE
puts long_string

#=>
# This is the first line
# and the second one
# here comes third
# and fourth
```

Note: You can use any word to designate the end of the lines of strings. The important part is that the last word matches the word following the `<<-` exactly.

### Practice
1. Set your name to the variable `name`
2. Use the `name` variable and string interpolation output the sentence "hello my name is" with your name at the end.
3. Adjust the variable below to print out this multi-line string:
```ruby
tortoise_and_hare = Hare ran down the road for a while and then and paused to rest.
He looked back at Slow and Steady and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?"
Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax."
Slow and Steady walked and walked.
He never, ever stopped until he came to the finish line.
```

## Numbers (Numerics)

#### Integers

```ruby
puts 122

#=> 122
```
If you break up a long number with commas, it will print out each section separately.

```ruby
#long numbers
puts 23,482,345,629

#=>
# 23
# 482
# 345
# 629
```

```ruby
#long numbers: substitute _ for ,
puts 23_482_345_629

#=> 23482345629
```

How Ruby handles integer division:

```ruby
#rounds down
puts 5 / 2

#=> 2
```

#### Floats

More information about the distinction between [floats and integers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zc6s4wx/revision/3)

#####
```ruby
p 5.0 / 2

#=> 2.5
```

##### float division
```ruby
p 5.fdiv 2

#=> 2.5
```
##### convert to float
```ruby
p 12.to_f

#=> 12.0
```

#### BigDecimal

```ruby
puts 1.2 - 1.0

#=> 0.19999999999999996
```

```ruby
require 'bigdecimal'
puts BigDecimal("1.2") - BigDecimal("1.0")

#=> 0.2E0
#output in scientific notation
```

```ruby
require ('bigdecimal');
puts BigDecimal('0.0000000000001')

#=> 0.1E-12
#output in scientific notation
```
### Practice
1. Display the sum of 10 and 15
2. Divide number 7 by 2. What's the result of the regular number versus when you do this when 7 and 2 are floats?
3. Ask a user for two numbers. Divide the first number by the second number and display this quotient. What do you need to do to show an accurate result?

#### Rational Numbers

```ruby
p 2.to_r

#=> (2/1)
```
```ruby
p Rational 0.5

#=> (1/2)
```
```ruby
#can use fraction notation
p 2/3r

#=> (2/3)
```
```ruby
#can combine fraction notation with other math
p 2/3r+1

#=> (5/3)
```

#### nil

```ruby
#same as null
a = nil
puts a

#=> empty

p a
#=> nil
```

## Booleans & Operators

Ruby and JavaScript treat `&&` and `||` the same.

```ruby
a = false;
b = true;

a && b #=> false
a || b #=> true
```


## Control Flow Operators
The `and` and `or` keywords serve the purpose of control flow operators.

The and and or keywords serve the same purpose in Ruby. Properly understood, and and or are control flow operators, not boolean operators.

#### and

`and` is useful for chaining related operations together until one of them returns nil or false. For instance:

```ruby 
post = Post.find_by_name(name) and post.publish
```

Here, the post will only be published if it is found, due to the short-circuiting nature of `and`.

#### or

```ruby
ready_to_rock? or p "Not ready!"
```

If `ready_to_rock` returns false, the application will print "Not ready!".

#### ==

We don't need triple equals `===` in Ruby when looking for equality. The double equals `==` will test for strict equality:

```ruby
puts `10` == 10

#=> false
```

#### Truthy and Falsey

There's a slight difference between Ruby and JavaScript here.
- In Ruby, only `false` and `nil` (`null` in JavaScript) are falsey.
- Everything else is truthy (even 0 is truthy).

Chart from https://learn.co/lessons/truthiness-in-ruby-readme

### Practice
Figure out whether the following will result in `true` or `false` and then run them to confirm your response.
1. true && true
2. ("blue" == "blue") or false
3. (1 == "1") || false

<hr>

## Data Structures
### Arrays
Note: When logging arrays, `puts` and `p` will give slightly different results. `p` is a more accurate representation of the datatype.

#### Can be created as a literal with `[]` and stores all of the datatypes.
```ruby
a = [1, "two", 3.0]
puts a

#=>
# 1
# two
# 3.0
```
```ruby
a = [1, "two", 3.0]
p a

#=> [1, "two", 3.0]
```

#### Range with beginning and ending number `..`
```ruby
b = Array(1..6) # 1-6
puts b

#=>
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
```

#### Range with beginning and ending number (not included) `...`
```ruby
c = Array(1...6)

#=>
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
```

### Practice
Based on what you just learned about Ruby arrays and what you know from JavaScript, try the following:

1. Create an empty array called `misc_array`
2. Save the number `1` to the spot at index `0` of the `misc_array`
3. Save the string "ham" to the spot at index `1` of the `misc_array`
4. Push the string "sandwich" onto the end of the `misc_array`

<hr>

### Hashes

A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.

While this is a new term, the structure should look familiar. Hashes are essentially JS objects, but without methods. They have key and value pairs assigned with hash rockets `=>`.

```ruby
domains = { 'de' => "Germany", 1 => "Slovakia", us: "United States" }
```

You can access the value by using the name of the object and the key name in `[]`
```ruby
puts domains

#=>{"de"=>"Germany", 1=>"Slovakia", us: "United States"}
```
```ruby
puts domains['de']

#=> Germany
```
```ruby
puts domains[1]

#=>Slovakia
```
```ruby
puts domains[:us]

#=>United States
```

NOTE: You can now use numbers as keys. There's also a new type of key called a "symbol".

#### Symbols

In Ruby a symbol's location in memory is immutable. A symbol can be used as a key or value in a hash.

There are two ways to set up a symbol in a hash.

1. Using a hash rocket `=>` is outdated as of Ruby 1.8, but you may see it online and in code elsewhere.

```ruby
#Using a string as a key
domains = { 'location' => "United States" }

#Using a symbol as a key (outdated syntax)
domains = { :location => "United States" }
```

2. The `:` **after** the symbol and no hash rocket.
```ruby
#Using a string as a key
domains = { 'location' => "United States" }

#Using a symbol as a key (new syntax)
domains = { location: "United States" }
```

- Symbols can also be assigned to variables.

```ruby
#string assigned to variable
light = 'on'

#symbol assigned to variable
light = :on
```

NOTE: There is an exception with numbers:

```ruby
hash = {1: 'one'} # will not work  
hash = {1 => 'one'} # will work
```

#### So why use a symbol?

When using values that won't change, we can use symbols.  Symbols are like strings, but are faster for the computer to access following reasons.

- For each symbol value, there is only one instance.  Symbols with the same value reference the same chunk of memory.

	```ruby
	first_name = :bob
	last_name = smith

	p :first_name.object_id
	#=> 898908

	p :first_name.object_id #:name is the same object in memory as :name on the previous line
	#=> 898908

	p "last_name".object_id
	#=> 70258517971100

	p "last_name".object_id #this is a different string, and therefore a different place in memory than "name" above
	#=> 70258517969980
	```

## Everything in Ruby is an Object

Every possible value has properties and methods:

```ruby
p true.class

#=>TrueClass
```
```ruby
p false.class

#=>FalseClass
```
```ruby
p "Ruby".class

#=> String
```
```ruby
p 1.class

#=> Fixnum
```
```ruby
p 4.5.class

#=> Float
```
```ruby
p 3_463_456_457.class

#=> Fixnum
```
```ruby
p :age.class

#=> Symbol
```
```ruby
p [1, 2, 3].class

#=> Array
```
```ruby
p({ :name => "Jane", :age => 17 }.class)
#=> Hash
```

### Conversion

Can easily convert between data types:

```ruby
puts '4'.to_i #to integer
puts 4.to_s #to string
```
```ruby
puts 5.to_f #to float
puts 0.5.to_r #to rational
```
```ruby
puts "Jane".to_sym #to symbol
```

## Methods

Methods in Ruby are like functions in JavaScript.

```ruby
def greeting
	puts 'Hello World!'
end
greeting()

#=> Hello World!
```
```ruby
greeting

#=> Hello World!
```

with params:

```ruby
def h(name)
	puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end
h("Mickey")

#=> Hello, Mickey!
```

or

```ruby
def h(name)
	puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

h "Mickey"

#=> Hello, Mickey!
```

## Flow of Control

### If/Else

Ruby's if / else conditionals are similar to JavaScript except the new term `elsif`

```ruby
a = 5

if a > 1
	p 'greater than 1'
elsif a == 1
	p 'equals 1'
else
	p 'less than 1'
end
```
### Unless
In Ruby, there's another conditional statement called `unless`

```ruby
a = 5

unless a >= 1
	p "less than 1"
end
```

You can write it in a single line

```ruby
a = 1
puts 'equals 1' if a == 1

#=> equals 1
```

```ruby
puts 'not greater than 1' unless a > 1
```

### While

```ruby
a = 0

while a < 5 do
	p a
	a+=1
end

#=>
0
1
2
3
4
```
NOTE: `++` syntax does not exist in Ruby. To increment by 1, you should use `+=`

### Until

```ruby
a = 0

until a == 5 do
	p a
	a+=1
end

#=>
0
1
2
3
4
```

### For

```ruby
for i in 0...5 do
	puts i
end

#=>
0
1
2
3
4
```

NOTE: in Ruby, for loops are not recommended to be used to iterate through arrays. Instead, the `.each` method (we will talk about this later) is used.

### Practice
1. Print out all of the numbers in a range of 10 - 100.
2. Using the same range, print out only the even numbers.
