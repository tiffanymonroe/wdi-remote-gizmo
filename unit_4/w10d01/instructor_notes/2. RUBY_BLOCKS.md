# Ruby - Blocks

## Lesson Objectives

1. Compare JS `forEach` with Ruby `each`
1. Compare JS `map` with Ruby `map`
1. Describe and use a proc

## Practice
Let's code each example together using the `compare.js` and `compare.rb` files that located in your `student_examples` folder.

## Compare JS forEach with Ruby each

Here's our JS forEach

```javascript
var myArray = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

myArray.forEach(function(str){
	console.log('the value is ' + str);
});
```

Here's the ruby version of the same code.

```ruby
myArray = ['one', 'two', 'three']

myArray.each do |str|
	puts 'the value is ' + str
end
```
or
```ruby
['one', 'two', 'three'].each do |str|
	puts 'the value is ' + str
end
```

All code from `do` to `end` is called a ruby "block", since it's a block of code that is executed.  It's just like the anonymous functions of JavaScript.

There's even a version of the `.each` method that is only one line long.

```ruby
 #short form

['one', 'two', 'three'].each { |str| puts 'the value is ' + str }
```

Note that this operation leaves the array unchanged.

### Practice

```ruby
disney_chars = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Goofy", "Donald", "Daisy", "Pluto"]
```
1. Using the `.each` method, log each item in the `disney_chars` array.

## Compare JS map with Ruby map

Here's our JS map

```javascript
var basicArray = [1,2,3];

var timesTwo = basicArray.map(function(num){
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(timesTwo);
```

Here's the ruby version of the same code

```ruby
basicArray = [1,2,3]

times_two = basicArray.map do |num|
	num * 2
end

p times_two
```
or

```ruby
times_two = [1,2,3].map do |num|
	num * 2
end

p times_two
```

Here's the version that takes only one line

```ruby
puts [1,2,3].map {|num| num * 2}
```

```ruby
basicArray = [1,2,3]

basicArray.map do |num|
	num * 2
end

p basicArray

#=> [1, 2, 3]
```

NOTE: `map` does not modify the original array. You can save the modified array to a new variable.

### Practice
```ruby
disney_chars = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Goofy", "Donald", "Daisy", "Pluto"]
```

1. Use `.map` to add an `s` to the end of each of the items in the `disney_chars` and output the result.

## Describe and use a proc

- Proc objects are blocks of code that have been bound to a set of local variables.
- Once bound, the code may be called in different contexts and still access those variables - procs are just ways to save functions into variables for later use
- procs are invoked by adding `.call` to the end of the variable name.

```ruby
log = Proc.new do |el|
	puts el
end

log.call(5)

#=>
```

Short version:

```ruby
log = Proc.new {|el| puts el}
log.call(5)
```

Another example:

```ruby
def gen_times(factor)
  Proc.new {|n| n*factor }
end
```
```ruby
# Create procs using the proc `gen_times`
times3 = gen_times(3)
times5 = gen_times(5)
```
```ruby
# Invoke the procs
times3.call(12)               #=> 36
times5.call(5)                #=> 25
times3.call(times5.call(4))   #=> 60
```

### Practice

1. Make a proc called `add_letters` that will take one parameter and will return it with a letter added to the end of it.
2. Make a variable called `adding_z` that will hold the proc and pass in the parameter `z`. When `adding_z` is invoked with a name, the result should be a name with the letter `z` at the end of the name.
