## Congratulations on finishing Project 3! Now let's move on to Ruby...

In Unit 4, you will be learning a new programming language called Ruby.

Give yourself time - there is a fair amount of work to get through (about 9 hours)!

https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby

1. Create or Log in to your codecademy account.
2. Start the Ruby tutorial.

NOTE: You do not need to "Upgrade". Only do the free portions of the tutorial (which should be all 10 sections - you won't be able to do the Unit 11 Unit Final Project).

## Take a screenshot of your badges & commit them

- There are a total of 10 units for this tutorial. *Take a screen shot* of each badge that you receive as you finish the unit.
- Save these badges to your homework folder for today.
- Create an issue that links directly to this homework folder so that we can see your badges.
