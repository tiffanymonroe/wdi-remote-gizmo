### Lesson Structure
You can opt to work on this on your own (or with partners of your choosing) or you can stay in the main room and all work together to help Karolin solve it. 


### Loop the Loop: 2D Array Additon

**Make a function that returns the greatest sum of a row, column or diagonal from a two dimensional array**


Make a function that takes one argument, a two dimensional array, where all the arrays are the same length, and returns the greatest sum of the numbers by row, column and diagonal.
```
var arr = [ [10, 20, 30],
            [40, 50, 60],
            [70, -80, 90] ];

greatestSum(arr); //180
```

#### Hungry for More?


Test your function on this data set and let me know if it was a row, column or diagonal that had the greatest sum!

```
var bigArray =
[ [ 887, -541, -430, -590, 117, 172, -319, -18 ],
  [ -269, 964, 209, 840, -456, 156, 365, -568 ],
  [ 289, -41, 488, 198, 240, 124, -427, 214 ],
  [ 452, 894, 968, -149, 683, 977, 741, -805 ],
  [ 181, -714, -950, 107, 800, 751, -143, 380 ],
  [ 152, 493, 707, 914, 37, 356, -625, 608 ],
  [ -345, 906, 83, 676, 723, 381, 557, -183 ],
  [ 199, -943, -710, 565, 193, 315, 281, 245 ] ];
```

**Still Hungry?**<br>

Create a function that takes one argument, an integer, that makes a 2D array of random integers between 0  and 1000 where the length of the rows and columns is determined by the argument.

Add a 30% chance that the integer will become negative.
