# AngularJS - Includes

## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe why we need includes
1. Include an external file
1. Include a template already in the HTML
1. Dynamically change includes

## Describe why we need includes

Includes allow us to take reusable content and move it into external files so that we don't copy and paste the same code over and over

## Include an external file

Use the following syntax to include an external html file. **Note the extra single quotes since it can take valid javascript**

```html
<div ng-include="'partials/included.html'"></div>
```

Inside this external file, you can do write normal html with angular directives.  You can even reference controllers outside of the file that are ancestors.

It does this via AJAX, but normally a browser cannot make an AJAX request to a file on a computer (insecure!).  Two ways around this:

- Start a basic http server from the command line
	- execute this command in the same directory as application: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Start up chrome with extra params
	- `open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files`

### Example

file: index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html >
<head>
	<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.8/angular.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body ng-app>
	<div ng-include="'partials/included.html'"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

file: partials/included.html
```html
oh hai!
```

## Include a template already in the HTML

Calling files via AJAX, can be slow.  We can have our templates embedded in the HTML on page load like so.  This is nice for reusable elements

file: index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.8/angular.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body ng-app>
	<div ng-include="'partial2.html'"></div>
	<script type="text/ng-template" id='partial2.html'>
		Template 2!!
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Dynamically change includes

Since our include can be javascript, we can set it to controller variables

file: index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html >
<head>
	<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.8/angular.min.js'></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/app.js"></script>
</head>
<body ng-app="MyApp">
	<main ng-controller="MainController as main">
		<button ng-click="main.changeInclude()">Click Me</button>
		<div ng-include="main.includePath"></div>
	</main>
</body>
</html>
```

When we change those variables like normal, the partial will update too

file: js/app.js
```javascript
const app = angular.module('MyApp', []);

app.controller('MainController', function(){
	this.includePath = 'partials/partial1.html';
	this.changeInclude = function(){
		this.includePath = 'partials/partial2.html';
	}
});
```

file: partials/partial1.html
```html
parital 1
```

file: partials/partial2.html
```html
parital 2
```
