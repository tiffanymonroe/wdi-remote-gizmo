# Lab - Todo List

## Description

Create a "To Do" application

## Basic goals

1. The page should list all to do items
1. Create a form at the bottom that will add a new todo item onto the list above

## Intermediate goals

1. Create a delete button next to each item on the todo list to remove that item

## Advanced goals

1. If you click on the item itself, the text should be replaced with an input field allowing you to edit the todo item.  Hitting return (submitting the form) will change that value in the controller and replace the input field for that item with the updated text
