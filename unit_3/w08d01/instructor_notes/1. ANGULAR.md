## Describe Single Page Apps and Why They're Great
- load one larger file for html/css/js which will run entire site
	- is faster than loading many smaller html/css/js files for each page
- if application is rendered on client side, it cuts down on the work needed by the server
	- server can run faster because there is less traffic to it
	- most people's computers can handle running the JS required for a single page application

## Describe what Angular.js does for us

- Allows us to structure our files in an MVC structure, so we'll have data, controllers, and html
	- this enforces a structure to our application that makes it easy to figure out where to make updates and keeps the code clean
- Simplifies process of updating the HTML based on data
	- remember in the games for Unit 1, when the JS data changed, we had to manually tell the HTML to update as well
	- with Angular, HTML updates whenever the data updates (two way data binding)

## Describe two way data binding
- Javascript Models are synchronized with HTML elements
- When properties in the model get updated, so does the UI.
- When UI elements get updated, the changes get propagated back to the model.
- Ex: in connect four, could have an array of arrays (matrix).
	- When a value is changed in the matrix, the HTML automatically shows a token on the board with no further coding

## Set up Angular

Add a script tag referencing the Angular library, just like when we used jQuery

file:index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```

## Explain Directive

1. HTML has pre-defined attributes on tags like `href`, `src`, `class`
1. You can come up with your own attributes as well: `<div matt="awesome"></div>`
1. Angular uses its own custom directives to tell the HTML which data it is bound to
	- they all start with `ng-`

## Describe Applications

1. `ng-app="MyApp"`
	- our first directive, placed probably in `<html>`
1. `const app = angular.module('MyApp', []);`
	- creates our application, which can hold many Controllers

file: index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="MyApp">
	<head>
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js"></script>
		<script src="app.js"></script><!-- add reference to controller js file -->
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```

file: app.js
```javascript
const app = angular.module('MyApp', []);
```

## Describe Controllers

1. Controllers control a certain area of the page
```javascript
app.controller('MyController', [function(){ //constructor function called MyController
	this.hello = 'oh hai!';
}]);
```
1. `ng-controller = "MyController as ctrl"`
	- instantiates MyController as an object with name `ctrl`
		- similar to `const ctrl = new MyController();`
	- can be placed on any element that is inside the element that has `ng-app` set
	- anything inside that element has access to anything on `ctrl` object

file:index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="MyApp">
	<head>
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js"></script>
		<script src="app.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
	</head>
	<body ng-controller="MyController as ctrl">
	</body>
</html>
```

file:app.js

```javascript
const app = angular.module('MyApp', []);

app.controller('MyController', [function(){ //constructor function called MyController
	this.hello = 'oh hai!';
}]);
```

## Common Directives

### reading values

1. ng-bind
	- binds the contents of the element to whatever is specified
1. {{}}
	- same as ng-bind, but not an attribute
1. ng-class
	- binds the class of an element to the result of an "expression"
		- an expression is just some code that gets evaluated
	- `(ctrl.isActive)?'active':''"`
		- if ctrl.isActive evaluates to true, the class of the element will be 'active'
	- `ng-class="{ active:ctrl.isActive }"`
		- a different way to write the same thing
1. ng-repeat
	- `<li ng-repeat="item in ctrl.items">{{item}}</li>`
	- loops through an array, creating duplicates of the element for each value in the array
	- can reference the current item, based on whatever value is given before `in`
	- use `{{$index}}` to get the index of the element in the array
	- ng-repeat doesn't like duplicate items in the array (`ng-repeat="element in [1,1,1]"`)
		- use `track by $index` to get around this
			- `ng-repeat="element in [1,1,1] track by $index"`
1. ng-if
	- `ng-if="ctrl.divExists"`
	- binds the existence of an element to the result of an expression
1. ng-show/hide
	- like ng-if, but it hides it, not removes it from the DOM
1. src
	- `<img src="{{ctrl.imgsrc}}" />`
	- sets the src of an img to the result of an expression

file:index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="MyApp">
	<head>
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js"></script>
		<script src="app.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
	</head>
	<body ng-controller="MyController as ctrl">
		<div ng-bind="ctrl.hello"></div><br/>
		{{ctrl.hello}}
		<section ng-class="(ctrl.isActive)?'active':''"></section>
		<ul>
			<li ng-repeat="item in ctrl.items">{{$index}}: {{item}}</li>
		</ul>
		<div ng-if="ctrl.divExists">Remove Me</div>
		<div ng-hide="ctrl.hideDiv">Hide Me</div>
		<div ng-show="ctrl.showDiv">Show Me</div>
		<img src="{{ctrl.imgSrc}}" />
	</body>
</html>
```

file: app.js
```javascript
const app = angular.module('MyApp', []);

app.controller('MyController', [function(){ //constructor function called MyController
	this.hello = 'oh hai!';
	this.isActive = true;
	this.items = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear'];
	this.divExists = false;
	this.hideDiv = true;
	this.showDiv = false;
	this.imgSrc = 'http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CzqzzBV2tMk/TxBM3ar18MI/AAAAAAAAPm0/6faLPO9BM8w/s1600/i-can-has-cheezburger.jpg';
}]);
```

### writing values

1. ng-model
	- `<input ng-model="ctrl.tab"/>`
	- binds ctrl.tab's value to whatever is the value of the input
1. ng-click
	- `<button ng-click="ctrl.tab = 4">Click Me</button>`
	- executes code when an element is clicked
1. ng-submit
	- executes code when form is submitted

file: index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="MyApp">
	<head>
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.1/angular.min.js"></script>
		<script src="app.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
	</head>
	<body ng-controller="MyController as ctrl">
		{{ctrl.someProperty}}
		<form ng-submit="ctrl.handleSubmit()">
			Change the property's value: <input type="text" ng-model="ctrl.someProperty"/><br/>
			<input type="submit" value="Submit The Form"/>
		</form>
		<div ng-click="ctrl.handleClick()">Click me</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

file: app.js

```javascript
const app = angular.module('MyApp', []);

app.controller('MyController', [function(){ //constructor function called MyController
	this.someProperty = 'foo';
	this.handleSubmit = function(){
		console.log('form submitted');
	}
	this.handleClick = function(){
		console.log('div clicked');
	}
}]);
```
