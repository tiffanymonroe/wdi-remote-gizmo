# setup use the flickr application in student labs

1.  Use the flickr API to make a photo gallery on the page
2.  First just create a module that retrieves photos of puppies from the flickr api 
using `flickr-sdk`

3.  Go to flickr api [flicker dev](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer)
4.  sign up for a key and register your app, it will bring you to a yahoo login sign up then choose other email and just put in whatever email you already have so you don't have to create another one
5. You should then be able to find your apiKey, and apiSecret following the steps they tell you.
6. Create an endpoint for your angular application to call to recieve the flickr images
7. display them on the page



### extra 
1. allow user input to search for photos
2. try different endpoints
3.  Play with angular and see what you can do, maybe make templates.  Whats a template? (google angular templates)
4. experiment with other apis. (check out programmable web)[apis](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)
