# Morning Exercise
# Happy Fun Ball

## A Lesson on Git Branches and Merging

### Lesson Objectives
_After this lesson, students will be able to:_

- Explain how git's version control allows developers to work differently on projects
- Explain what a git branch is
- Make a git branch
- Switch between branches
- Merge branches
- Resolve a merge conflict

### Git Refresher
So far, you have been using git to get code (pull) from a remote repository (on github), writing your own code, tracking it with git, and moving (push) the code from your computer (local version) to github.

When using git locally (on your computer), you have been running the commands in Terminal (Command line).

A git command has a minimum of 1 argument.

Git commands are always executed by first typing `git`

The first argument is the command (or verb), like
- `git init` (initialize a new git repository)
- `git push` (send the code to a remote location)

The second(+) argument gives the first argument context (when needed)
- `git add .` (add all files in this directory)
- `git pull origin master` (get all files from the url that has an alias of `origin`, from the branch `master`)

Lastly, flags can be added
- `git remote -v` (git show remote(s) and be verbose(give more detail))

Here is a table of our commonly used git commands that we've used in this course so far:

| git | Argument | Flag(s)/Additional arguments | Description |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| git | init |  |  Initializes a new repository|
| git | add | `.` or filename | Takes untracked files and adds them to the staging area so that they can be committed   |
| git | commit | -m 'some message'  |  Takes a snapshot of files in the staging area/ saves this version of them as a commit|
| git | remote | -v |  Shows the remote repositories associated with the local repository. Most repositories have an alias for their urls like `origin` or `upstream`|
| git | pull | upstream master |  Gets files from a url with an alias of `upstream` from its branch `master`|
| git | push | origin dev |  Sends files to a url with an alias of `origin` to its branch `dev`|
| git | log| --oneline |  Shows a log of commits of a repo (--oneline shows a truncated message)_`q` to exit_|
| git | status |  |  Shows the state of files in a repo (untracked, modified, staged)|

[Link to our wiki with a more complete list of git commands](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote-matrix/wiki/Git-Cheatsheet)

Note: `fork` is not on this list because `fork` is not a git command; it is github-specific for copying a repository on github to a new location on github.

### Git VCS - Branches and Merging
Git is a VCS (Version Control System). There are a few popular ones, but git ends up being a top choice because of its branching and merging feature.

If we think back to our past projects, when we wanted to implement some major changes to our code and failed our popular options were to
- `⌘Z` throughout our files and hope for the best
- Comment out a ton of code and hope to restore the functionality of our code to a previous version
- Seriously contemplate coding out our project from scratch again
- Curl up into a ball and hope the code would revert via magic

[Git's about page has 4 great reasons why it works so well for individuals and large teams.](https://git-scm.com/about)

- Frictionless Context Switching - Switch between branches, whenever! No worries!
- Role-Based Codelines - Have many versions of your code - Production, Development, Day-to-Day etc.
- Feature Based Workflow - Create a new branch for each feature
- Disposable Experimentation - if a branch doesn't work out, you can just walk away or toss it. It has no impact on the working code

You may be thinking 'this sounds too good to be true!' It's not! But there is a catch! Git requires changing the way we are used to working on projects. Which means it takes some time and practice to learn to use git.

### New Git Commands
To be able to use branches, we will have to learn some new git commands

| git | Argument | Flag(s)/Additional arguments | Description |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| git | branch |  |  Lists branches |
| git | branch | branch_name |  Creates a new branch |
| git | checkout | branch_name | Switches branches |
| git | checkout | -b new_branch_name  |  Creates a new branch and switches to that branch|
| git | diff |  |  Let's you see the changes that you have made (before `git add`)|

Even though these are just five new commands, it is going to take some practice to master them. Let's get started!

Note: You may have noticed that `git merge` is missing - we will be merging our branches via github, so we will not use this command.

## Scenario
You have been hired by Wacky Products Incorporated. They are just weeks away from starting a global marketing campaign for their new hot product Happy Fun Ball and they want a top-notch web page to be launched as soon as possible.

Mysteriously, the entire dev team has lapsed into comas and it is up to you to save the project.

As a professional developer, you will do whatever it takes to finish this project! Everything, BUT work directly on the master branch!


### Setup
#### Part 1 - Get the files
###### Browser - github:
- Fork Happy-Fun-Ball (make a copy of this remote repository to your github account):
 - [Go here]( https://github.com/Krafalski/hfb) and click fork (upper right) to fork it to your personal repo (Don't worry! You can totally delete it after the lesson!)
  <details><summary>Show Screenshot</summary>
  
  ![Upper right on github](https://i.imgur.com/TjcbBOB.png)
  
  </details>
- Navigate to YOUR version on YOUR github repo
- Click the 'clone or download' button (on the right, below fork).
  <details><summary>Show Screenshot</summary>
  
  ![Copy or Clone button](https://i.imgur.com/6uAnb0R.png)
  
</details>
This will give you the option to copy the link to your clipboard and make it ready to paste in the command line.
- REMEMBER: This should be from YOUR repo (the link to be copied should be `git@github.com:your-github-handle/hfb.git`)

###### Command line:
- Navigate to a directory **OUTSIDE** of wdi-remote-hopper
`mkdir` (if you need to)
- ```$git clone `git@github.com:your-github-handle/hfb.git` ``` (use `⌘V` to paste the url from github)
- The above command should create a new folder inside your current directory and make copy of everything in the Happy Fun Ball remote repository, locally (on your computer) and initialize git.
 Let's check:
  - `cd hfb` into the cloned directory and then
  - `ls` and check that
    - `index.html` and
    - `main.css` are in your folder (`README.md` & `hfb.png` will also be there)
  - `git status`
<details><summary>Example output</summary>  
`On branch master`<br>
`Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.`<br>
`nothing to commit, working tree clean`

</details>

  - `git remote -v` - to check your remote set up <details><summary>Example Output</summary>
  `origin    git@github.com:your-github-handle/hfb.git (fetch)`<br>
   `origin    git@github.com:your-github-handle/hfb.git (push)`

</details>

#### Part 2 - Configure Git to Have Autocorrect
To help with today's lesson let's be sure we have autocorrect on.
Let's test:
###### Command line:
- `git chekotu`<details><summary>Example output:</summary>
`git: 'chekotu' is not a git command.
 See 'git --help'.`
<br><br>
`Did you mean this?`<br>
	`checkout`


</details>

We can configure git to have autocorrect, if it is not already set as a default. We are going to install it locally (just to this repository). If you end up liking the configuration, you can always install it globally, later.

###### Command line:
- `git config --local help.autocorrect` -if the setting has updated, there will be no message
- try mistyping a git command `git chekotu`<details><summary>Example output:</summary>
`git: 'chekotu' is not a git command.
 See 'git --help'.`
<br><br>
`Did you mean this?`<br>
	`checkout`


</details>


#### Part 3 - Make a Dev Branch
###### Command line:
- To make a new branch AND checkout the new branch(we will call our new branch 'dev'):
- `git checkout -b dev` <details><summary>Example output</summary>
`Switched to a new branch 'dev'`
 </details>

- `ls`
  - `index.html` & `main.css`, etc. - should still be there
- `git status` to confirm everything looks like it should <details><summary>Example output</summary>
`On branch dev` <br>
`nothing to commit, working tree clean`
</details>

- Get this branch on your github repo:
- `git push origin dev`<details><summary>Example output</summary>
` * [new branch]      dev -> dev`
</details>

###### Browser - github:
- See your new branch on github (it should be there, refresh if you don't see it. If you still don't see it, let me know and we'll trouble shoot)
It will be a new message along the top of github OR from clicking the `Branch: master` button <details><summary> Screeshot </summary>

![pull-down menu](https://i.imgur.com/oIptMUM.png)

</details>

###### Command line:
- `atom .`open the files in atom
- `open index.html`open index.html in the browser (remember you can do `open i` and then press `tab` to autocomplete index.html)

#### Part 3 - Organize yourself
We are going to be going between the browser, the command line and Atom frequently. Be sure you can work efficiently and effectively by setting up a good workflow! Start by organizing your browser, command line and Atom so that you can easily switch between them (don't forget to use Spectacle). Close extra tabs and browser windows.  <details><summary> Here is how I worked on this project(You will have to also account for Zoom and Slack): </summary>

![window organization](https://i.imgur.com/WAUMTBR.png)


**Browser:**
- My repo
- Happy Fun Ball `index.html`
- README.md for this lesson
- Color Names (we'll be referring to this a few times, there is a link below)
- All other tabs are closed, no other Browser windows are open

**Atom:**
- directory tree (toggle view: `⌘\`).
  -  See all Atom shortcuts : `⌘⇧P`
- index.html
-  main.css

</details>

Take a couple minutes to get familiar with the code you'll be working on.

### New Feature - Link the HTML and CSS
Your first new feature!  Working in `index.html`, you will add a link to `main.css`, then you will merge it into the dev branch, and then into master.

#### Part 1 - Make a New Branch
###### Command line:
- Let's make a new branch specifically for our new feature
- `git branch` - to check that you are on the `dev` branch. This command will show all the branches and highlight the one you are on. <details><summary>Example output:</summary>

 ![example output of `git branch`](https://i.imgur.com/2bKy3zL.png)
</details>


- `git checkout -b link-files` - this will create a new branch (a copy of the branch we are switching from, in this case: `dev`) called `link-files` and check it out
<details><summary>Example output:</summary>
`Switched to a new branch 'link-files'`

</details>

#### Part 2 - Work on New Feature
###### Atom - index.html :
- In the index.html - between the` </title>` and `</head>` tags, let's insert a link to our css :
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">`
- `⌘S` - Save our changes in atom

###### Browser - index.html:
- `⌘R` - Reload our browser view of the `index.html`
- The CSS should now be loaded into our `index.html`

#### Part 3 - Feature Completed! Use Git to Track/Add it

###### Command line:
- `git status`
- `git add index.html`
- `git commit -m 'index.html and main.css linked'`
- `git push origin link-files`  (Remember: `origin`and `link-files` can be autocompeletd by using `tab`) <details><summary>Example output:</summary>
`Counting objects: 3, done.`<br>
`Delta compression using up to 4 threads.`<br>
`Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.` <br>
`Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 402 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.`<br>
`Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)`<br>
`remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local objects.`<br>
`To github.com:Krafalski/hfb.git`<br>
` * [new branch]      link-files -> link-files`

</details>
- Check github to see that the new branch is there <details><summary> Screenshot</summary> ![github new branch screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/YtFNJEk.png)
</details>

#### Part 4 - Merge New Feature into Dev Branch
###### Browser - github:
- See new branch (either a message will pop up or use the left side pull down to see) <details><summary>Screenshot</summary>![image from below of github](https://i.imgur.com/YtFNJEk.png)
</details>

- You will either have a yellow bar with your branch name and a green `compare & pull request`or you will have to choose the `Pull requests` tab (the yellow bar does not always appear. It does not automatically mean that something is wrong)

Note: if you do not get the yellow bar, you will have slightly different navigation to complete this step, a detailed outline is down below in the `Part 6: Merge Dev Branch into Master` section.
- Push the `Compare & pull request button` that is on the right of the yellow bar
- Select `base:dev` and `compare: link-files`
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
![github pull request](https://i.imgur.com/AW5kmXJ.png)
</details>
- Wait a moment to let github tell you if there are any merge conflicts <details><summary>Screenshot</summary> ![image of able to merge](https://i.imgur.com/Q3BzVry.png)
</details>

- All clear! Go ahead and press the `Create pull request` button, wait a moment and you should see a green `Merge pull request` button about midway down. <details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
![Merge pull request view](https://i.imgur.com/MlXlXg3.png)
</details>
- Press the button, then the button will change to say `Confirm merge` press it again to confirm the merge! <details><summary>Screenshot</summary> ![image of a successful merge on github](https://i.imgur.com/QFpGVAQ.png)
</details>
<br>
 Note: When you work on a team it is unlikely that you would merge your own pull requests

 Note: You can refuse a merge and close the pull request by pressing the grey `Close pull request` button further down

#### Part 5 - Get the Latest Remote Version of Dev, Locally
###### Command line:
- `git checkout dev` (Notice: no `-b`)
- `git pull origin dev`

- Check Atom (`index.html` has the link to CSS)
- Your browser view (`index.html` is displaying with CSS loaded - don't forget to `⌘R`/refresh your browser to be sure you are seeing the updated version)

- If everything looks good, let's merge these changes into the master branch

#### Part 6 - Merge Dev Branch into Master
###### Command line:

- `git pull origin master` (this should come back as clean but it is a good habit to pull before you push)
<details><summary>Example output</summary>
`From github.com:Krafalski/hfb`<br>
` * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD` <br>
`Already up-to-date.`

</details>

- `git push origin dev` (this should also come back as clean - since we have changed nothing in our code), it is good to get in the habit of checking yourself often!
<details><summary>Example output</summary>
`Everything up-to-date`
</details>

###### Browser - github :
- If you are still on the merge page, navigate back to the main view
- Open the `Pull Requests` tab
- On the right select the green `New pull request` button
- Compare `base: master` to `compare: dev`
- Wait to be sure there are no conflicts
- Green `Ceate pull request` button
- New screen that lets you add comments, midway to the right press green `Create pull request` button
- green `Merge Pull Request` button
- green `Confirm Pull Request` button

###### Command line:
- `git checkout master`(Notice: no `-b`)
- `git pull origin master`

###### Atom/Browser
- Check to make sure everything has updated as expected (`index.html` has link to css and when you refresh the browser, the CSS still loads)

### New Feature - Update the colors
 Work on a new feature: Working in the `main.css` file, you will update the colors of the Happy Fun Ball web page

###### Command line:
- Before we begin, let's make a new branch specifically for our new feature:
  - Check that you are on the dev branch **
  - `git branch` will list all your branches and have a `*` next to the branch you are on. Then:
  - `git checkout dev`
  -  `git checkout -b color-updates`


  ** GOTCHA: Branches can be created off any other branch. Be sure you are on the branch that you want to branch off of before creating a new branch!

###### Atom - index.html:
- You probably noticed that index.html had a typo! On (or around) line 19 `class="pr"` should actually be `class="price"`.
- Let's update that! (Don't forget `⌘S`/save) Now, it's not really our task, or our file to work on, but we're just being proactive and  helpful! What could possibly be wrong with that?

###### Command line:
- Let's go ahead and
- `git status`
- `git add index.html` and
- `git commit -m 'fixed typo in index.html'`, there! We added our changes and put in a descriptive commit message. We are undoubtedly awesome.

###### Atom - main.css:
- Now let's update the colors in the `body`, let's change `color` (font color), and `background-color` to whatever our heart desires. [Go ahead and use hexadecimal colors, rgb, hsl or some of the standard web colors.]( http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/)

Make changes here in main.css ![main.css](https://i.imgur.com/1WY4xj8.png)
- When we've found the colors we like, we can go ahead and
- ``⌘S`/save`

###### Command line:
- `git status` - see the status of our files
- `git diff` - see what we have changed
- `git add main.css` and
- `git commit -m 'updated colors'`
- `git log --oneline` -see our commits so far (`q` to exit)

### See Branching in Action
###### Command line:
- `git checkout dev` (Notice: no `-b`)

###### Atom - main.css:
- See that our changes are gone

###### Browser - index.html:
- Refresh the page and see that the page has reverted to the original version

Let's get back to our changes!
###### Command line:
- `git checkout color-updates` (don't forget you can use `tab` to autocomplete branch names too!)

Go through atom and the browser to see that your changes have come back

###### Atom - main.css:
- Let's make one more color change, now that we are on our color-updates branch. `.price` change the color from orange, to whatever color you want
- Can't find `.price`?
- `⌘F` will open a find/replace tab at the bottom of Atom and let you look for `.price`
- `esc` to close the find/replace tab
- make your changes (we are changing the color of elements with the class of `price`)
- `⌘S` -Don't forget to save your file
- Refresh your browser to see your changes

### Starting on a New Feature When We Haven't Finished Our Previous One
There was an error! The price of Happy Fun Ball is supposed to be $24.95, not $14.95!
<br>

Let's make a new branch off of the dev branch to hotfix this major problem! **

###### Command line:
- `git checkout dev`<br>
- Oops! We forgot to `git add .` & `git commit -m''`!!


`error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:` <br>
	`main.css` <br>
`Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.` <br>
`Aborting`
- We will commit our changes (we will not cover `stash` today):

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'changed .price color'`
-  `git checkout dev`
- `git checkout -b price-fix` to make a new branch off of dev (and automatically be switched to the new branch) **

###### Atom - index.hmtl:
- Update the price of happy fun ball from `$14.95` to `$24.95` (~ line 19 of `index.html`)
- `⌘S`/save

###### Command line:
- `git add index.html`
- `git commit -m 'fixed price of Happy Fun Ball in index.html'`
- `git pull origin dev` (this should come back clean, but it is good practice to pull before pushing)
- `git push origin price-fix` to create a new branch on github

** GOTCHA:  Branches can be created off any other branch. Be sure you are on the branch that you want to branch off of before creating a new branch!

### Merging Our New Feature into the Dev branch
###### Browser - github:
- See our new branch (either a message will pop up or use the left side pull down to see) <details><summary>Screenshot</summary>![github screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/mgEzi40.png)
</details>
- Select the `Pull requests` tab
- On the right side, push the `New pull request` button
- Select `base: dev` and `compare: price-fix`
- Wait a moment to let github tell you if there are any merge conflicts
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary> ![github all clear](https://i.imgur.com/L72S16y.png)
</details>

- All clear! Go ahead and press the `Create pull request` button
- A new screen will appear, enter a message if you like, otherwise push the `Create pull request button`
- `merge pull request` button, wait a moment, then go ahead and confirm the merge! (Note: when you work on a team, it is unlikely that you would merge your own pull requests)
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>![Merge Pull Request message and button](https://i.imgur.com/2yUuGmq.png)
</details>

### Going Back to Our Updated Colors Feature
- Whew! That was exciting! It's nice to be back to working on this feature. We know there were changes to the `dev` branch, so let's get them

###### Command line:
- `git checkout color-updates`
- `git pull origin dev` - to pull down your changes from the remote to your local copy

...

...

...

ERROR! Merge conflict! Example output:

`* branch            dev -> FETCH_HEAD`<br>
`c1df4fd..cc1ba3e  dev        -> origin/dev`<br>
`Auto-merging index.html` <br>
`CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html`<br>
`Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.`

**Uh-oh...**

### Merge Conflict (and Resolution)!

###### Atom - index.html :

- View the conflict in Atom
![index.html file](https://i.imgur.com/itPVnM1.png)

- Delete  everything between (including these lines as well) `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `========`:

Which is ALL of this:

`<<<<<<< HEAD`<br>
      `<h3 class="price">Only $14.95</h3>`<br>
`=======` <br>


- This conflict is our doing, let's get rid of our mistake from working in index.html when we were only supposed to be working in main.css and keep the change made from the price-fix branch

- Now that we've removed the conflict let's finish cleaning up the conflict and remove the line
`>>>>>>> 3b73c340f2c158a80ce20828fd94ad83ea60b444`

Note: your numbers/letters after the `>>>>>>>` should be different
- Let's also clean up any extra white space
- `⌘S`

###### Command line:
- `git add index.html`
- `git commit -m 'fixed merge conflict'`
- `git push origin color-updates` <details><summary>Example output</summary>
`Counting objects: 11, done.`<br>
`Delta compression using up to 4 threads.`<br>
`Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.` <br>
`Writing objects: 100% (11/11), 1.05 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.` <br>
`Total 11 (delta 7), reused 0 (delta 0)`<br>
`remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (7/7), completed with 3 local objects.`<br>
`To https://github.com/your-github-handle/hfb`<br>
` * [new branch]      color-updates -> color-updates`<br>
</details>

- We fixed it! Now we can continue working on our project


### Finishing and Merging Your Color Updates

###### Atom main.csss:
- Make your final updates to `main.css`

###### Command line:
- `git add main.css`
- `git commit -m 'updated colors'`
- `git push origin color-updates`

###### Browser - github :
- Pull Request
- Compare `base: dev` to `compare: color-updates`
- Wait to be sure there are no conflicts
- Create Pull Request
- Merge Pull Request
- Confirm Pull Request

###### Command line:
- `git checkout dev`
- `git pull origin dev`

###### Atom index.html/main.css :
- Take the time to review that the changes to the dev branch that you wanted are there and there are no errors or bugs
- **Only working code should ever be merged to master!**

- If everything is ok, go ahead and merge the changes to master
- If you made changes, don't forget to
- `git add` and
-  `git commit -m ''`

###### Command line:
- `git pull origin dev` (yes, we _just_ did this, but it is a good habit to do a pull before doing a push. It is ok if git tells you `Already up-to-date` )
- `git push origin dev` (it is ok if git tells you that `Everything up-to-date`)

###### Browser - github:
- Pull request
- Compare `base: master` to `compare: dev`
- Wait to be sure there are no conflicts
- Create Pull Request
- Merge Pull Request
- Confirm Pull Request
- Check to see that your changes have been successfully made to the master branch

### Hungry for More?
#### Continue with Happy Fun Ball
- Make a new branch, continue to update the Happy Fun Ball web page, and merge back your changes (New Feature Ideas: change color of Happy Fun Ball. Add a google font. Add some js/jQuery to show/hide Happy Fun Ball's Warnings.)
- Research and try `git stash`
- Delete a branch locally and remotely :
  - `git push origin --delete branch_name`
  - `git branch -d branch_name`
  

##### Sudden and Permanent Shut Down of Wacky Products Incorporated
- Well, it was fun while it lasted?
