## Congratulations on finishing Project 2! Now let's move on to Angular...

In Unit 3, you will be learning AngularJS (Angular 1), a Javascript framework that was created by Google and is widely used in creating dynamic websites. Since we have such limited time in this course, we want to ensure that you get a head-start on Angular by going through this tutorial.

Give yourself time - you won't be able to get through the tutorial in 1 day!


1. Before you begin, you will need to create an account for Code School.

NOTE: We don't expect you to pay for any of the courses. Only complete the work / follow along with  the sections that are free.

## Complete a tutorial:

- [Code School Angular Part 1](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs)

- [Code School Angular Part 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/staying-sharp-with-angularjs)

## Take a screenshot of your badges & commit them

- Take a screen shot of each badge that you get.

- Save these badges to your homework folder for today.

- Create an issue that links directly to this homework folder so that we can see your badges.

# Hungry for More?

Start [reading the Angular documentation](https://angularjs.org/). Note that we are learning Angular 1 (not the same as Angular 2).
