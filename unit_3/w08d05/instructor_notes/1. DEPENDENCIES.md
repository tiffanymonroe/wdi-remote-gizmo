# AngularJS - Advanced

## Lesson Objectives

1. Explain what dependencies do
1. Create a module and inject it into another one

## Explain what dependencies do

- We can group functionality together into different modules
- You can have multiple ng-apps on your page, each with specific functionality
- Modules can be dependent on other modules
- Very large modules can be broken out into smaller sub modules, grouped by functionality

## Create a module and inject it into another one

In this example, imagine we have a very large module for our "store" app.  Since we don't want one very large file, we can break it apart into many smaller files.

This first file will be module just for the store directives

file: js/store-directives.js
```javascript
const app = angular.module('store-directives', []);
app.directive('productTitle', function(){
	// directive stuff
});
app.directive('productGallery', function(){
	// directive stuff
});
```

We can now include the module for our directives in the store as a whole

file: js/store.js
```javascript
const app = angular.module('store', ['store-directives']);
```
