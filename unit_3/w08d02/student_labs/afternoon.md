# Lab - Afternoon

Create an interface to the API using Angular

1. It should show be able to create a new model via ajax
1. It should display all the models
1. You should be able to update a specific model
1. You should be able to delete a specific model

**Stretch:**

Go back and update the Todo list from the afternoon:

1. Create an edit link that shows a form for changing the description of the todo
1. The form should also have a delete button which deletes the item from the list entirely
1. Create a button to delete all checked items in the list

**Extreme Stretch:**

Go back and update the Todo list from the afternoon so that we can change the order of the todos

1. Change the todo model so that it has a "priority" number
1. When displaying all todos, order them by priority
1. Make buttons that will increase/decrease an item's priority
1. How do we deal with todos with the same priority?
