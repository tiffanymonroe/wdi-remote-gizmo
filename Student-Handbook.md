## The 5 E’s for How to Succeed in an Online Course

<details><summary>**Establish a dedicated, quiet, comfortable workspace**</summary>
<br>
You are in the classroom. It just happens to be in your home. It will be really important to have a set up that lets you step out of your home and into your classroom. Setting up a desk in a quiet place in your home can help put you in the learning mindspace. You will be interacting and talking with your instructors and classmates throughout the day, so it is important that you are able to do so from your setup. Also, a comfortable chair goes a long way! You’ll be at your desk for almost 8 hours a day — make sure to have a chair you can sit in for that entire time!
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**Enhance your focus**</summary>
<br>
The temptation to do other things during class may never go away. There are too many cat videos out there for that to happen. Instead, do your best to remove any potential distractions from your workspace. Allow yourself to check your phone and other websites only at breaks in the class. On your computer, close out other tabs and programs other than what you need to have open for the class. If you need help to stop surfing other websites, there are actually plugins you can download that will lock you out of websites of your choosing for a specific time. Read about one option for Chrome [here](http://osxdaily.com/2007/03/19/block-access-to-specified-sites-by-modifying-etchosts/). Set yourself goals along the way that help you get better at eliminating distractions. This will take some practice and will not only benefit you now but also when you start your career as a web developer.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**Engage with the class**</summary>
<br>
Jump into this. You will get out of this class what you put into it. Have fun. Support your classmates by commenting on their work. Ask your instructors and classmates questions on Slack or during standups. Attempt to do all activities and answer all questions regardless of who might have already answered in Slack. Don’t worry about making mistakes - that’s one of the best ways for you to learn. This experience is going to feel a bit strange at first if you’ve never taken an online class like this before (and given the way we’ve developed this course, you probably haven’t). We have built this course to keep you constantly engaged and to apply what you’re learning.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**Energize yourself**</summary>
<br>
So much of your success will be about staying motivated throughout the day, and your energy level will affect that. Keep healthy snacks such as fruits and almonds on hand for when your energy level starts to wane. Also, hydrate constantly! During breaks or whenever your energy level is getting low, do some jumping jacks to wake up. Twenty-five jumping jacks can go a long way to getting your blood pumping and your energy level back up. Also, consider using a blue light decreasing app, such as f.lux.  It decreases your screen's blue light as the sun goes down to keep screen time from negatively impacting your sleep cycle. A good night’s rest will go a long way to keeping you energized the next day.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**Escape your house at least once a day**</summary>
<br>
You wake up. You are in class all day. You eat. You go to sleep. Repeat the process the next day. It is very easy to get in this routine. We encourage you to get outside at least once a day, otherwise home and work will start to feel like the same thing. Go out for a walk, bike ride, or drive. Go to a restaurant for dinner. Visit a friend. Find some reason to leave the house at least once a day to ensure that you stay motivated throughout the class and don’t feel like being at home means you’re always at work. Getting away even for an hour at the end of the day can help you delineate being at work and being at home.

## Communication

#### If you have a question during a lesson:
- Post your questions or comments in the wdir-hopper Slack classroom. Questions will be addressed by the instructors who are active for the lesson.
- To reduce confusion, you will mute yourself on Zoom as soon as you sign on to Zoom. If called upon to speak, you will unmute yourself.
- If you are having a technical issue, you can send a direct message to the instructor who is supporting during the lesson. This will most likely be your Student Experience IA. Your contact for support will be posted on Slack at the start of each lesson.
- Please do not send a direct message to the on-camera instructor while the lesson is taking place.

#### Ways to communicate with other students:
- Make your own Zoom meeting room
- Send a Slack Direct Message
- Make a Slack Call

#### If you are unable to connect to the internet:
- Contact the instructional team via slack message or email from your phone so that we can setup a backup plan for you. Contact information is at the bottom of this document.

**NOTE:** If you do not have a smartphone, let us know immediately.

## Student Conduct and Dismissal
General Assembly is a community of learners. Should a student be disruptive to the community, he or she may be asked to leave. Examples of disruption include, but are not limited to:

Aggression or threats towards other students, instructors, or staff; illegal activities conducted or discussed on or around campus; the failure to observe classroom or campus conduct standards set forth by instructors or staff; or other behavior identified as disruptive to the learning environment of other students by instructors or staff.

Students may also be withdrawn for academic violations, per General Assembly’s withdrawal policy below. Students are to treat all members of the staff and other students with respect and dignity. A student who is caught cheating; willfully destroying school property; attending school under the influence of illegal drugs and/or alcohol; or exhibiting disruptive, insubordinate, boisterous, obscene, vulgar, or disrespectful behavior may be dismissed and prohibited from re-enrollment in another course.

Students dismissed due to disruptive and/or disrespectful conduct will not be re-admitted to General Assembly.


## Equal Opportunity
General Assembly is an equal opportunity organization and does not discriminate based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, or other categories protected by law of the states in which we operate.

General Assembly strictly prohibits and does not tolerate sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment (including verbal, physical, or visual conduct) based on protected status. Individuals who believe they have been subject to or witnessed conduct that violates this policy should immediately notify the Regional Director. All complaints will be investigated and prompt corrective action will be taken, as appropriate. Interim measures may be taken, as appropriate, when a complaint is made.

General Assembly prohibits retaliation against any individual who raises concerns under this policy or participates in an investigation. General Assembly will conduct its courses, services and activities consistent with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

Students who seek accommodations related to a disability should contact their Producer or Regional Director. General Assembly provides reasonable accommodations to individuals who desire to participate in our educational programs.


## Plagiarism Policy
General Assembly, and your instructional team, take plagiarism very seriously. The code you write in class should reflect your current understanding of the material, and should be representative of your own original thoughts. That said, you will often be required to use code that’s not yours to string these thoughts together, or to provide additional functionality.   

Additionally, if you do include any code that you didn’t write in your projects / homework, you must include a  RESOURCES.md file in your repository notating: the original source of the code, the team which wrote it, and how it’s being used in your project. You must also have a comment in your code referencing the corresponding line number in your RESOURCES.md.

<details><summary>**Definition**</summary>
<br>
Simply put, plagiarism involves both stealing someone else's work or idea and lying about it afterward; an act of cheating.  Plagiarised work includes turning in code that you didn’t write or building someone else’s idea without giving credit.  As broken down by Plagiarism.org, to “plagiarise” is to:
Steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own
Use (another's production) without crediting the source
Commit literary or code theft
Present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**Policy**</summary>
<br>
General Assembly has a zero tolerance policy towards plagiarism and cheating.  It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community.  Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements.  If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.”  Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).
<br><br>
Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project.  However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating** </summary>
<br>Turning in work that is not your own.
Turning in someone else's work as your own.
Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
Copying words or code without giving credit.
Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
Giving incorrect information about a source.
Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
<br><br>
**NOTES:**
A source can be considered anything found on the internet (i.e. Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.), an instructor, or another classmate.
Plagiarism is NOT the same as copyright infringement
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**How to avoid plagiarism**</summary>
<br>
Don’t copy a classmate’s work by looking at their published work, homework repository, works in progress, or looking at their screen.  If you need help, ask for it.
Don’t build an idea that is not yours without the source’s prior knowledge and consent.
Check for a project’s license.  Some common ones include MIT License, Creative Commons, and GNU GPL.
Give credit to the code you’ve borrowed or adapted.  At a minimum, put a link to the source in a code comment.
GA expects all course students to be able to explain the usage, meaning, and/or implementation of any code submitted and declared work of the student.
If you’re ever in doubt or unsure, talk to your instructor.
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>**Examples of Plagiarism**</summary>
<br>This **is** plagiarism:<br>
- Looking over someone’s shoulder and copying what they have done.<br>
- Paying or asking someone to do your work for you.<br>
- Implementing a CSS framework like Skeleton, but renaming some classes and keywords to pass it off as your own.<br>
- Cloning another student's project and passing it off as your own<br>
- Cloning anyone's repo and passing it off as your own without attribution<br>
- Using code from a tutorial or class lesson as the majority of your submission<br>
