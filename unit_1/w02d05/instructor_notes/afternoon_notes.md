## Lesson Objectives

1. EVERYTHING acts like an object, review call backs
1. loop through objects
1. use map, filter, reduce, and forEach on arrays


## Setup

1. Inside `student_examples` directory for today make a directory called `afternoon_lesson`
2. Inside the `afternoon_lesson` directory, add an `index.html` and an `app.js` inside a javascripts folder and link them together.
3.  Add a `console.log()` to your `app.js` and check to see that it is loading in your chrome console.

## JavaScript Callback Functions

Because functions are first-class objects, we can pass a function as an argument in another function and later execute that passed-in function or even return it to be executed later. This is the essence of using callback functions in JavaScript

**Callback functions** are derived from a programming paradigm known as functional programming. At a fundamental level, functional programming specifies the use of functions as arguments.

**Use Named OR Anonymous Functions as Callbacks**


&#x1F535; **Code Along**
```
const tellJoke = function(laughAtJoke){
  console.log("Here's a joke...");

  laughAtJoke();
}

const laughAtJoke = function() {
  console.log("hahahha");
}

// invoke a function and pass another function as a parameter
tellJoke(laughAtJoke);
```

&#x1F535; **Activity**

#### Callbacks
1. Create a variable called `responseToGreeting` and have it point to an anonymous function that logs ("I'm good, thanks for asking");
2. Create another variable called `myGreeting` and have it point to an anonymous function that takes one parameter (a callback function), and logs "Hello, how are you?".
3. Finally, within `myGreeting`, execute the callback function that is passed through argument.
4. Call `myGreeting` and pass `responseToGreeting` as an argument.

### Map

**Syntax**<br>
`array.map(function(){})`

This higher-order function is like a `for loop`. The difference from a `for loop` is that it's used for **transforming** values. You enter an array and what is returned is an array, but with transformed values.

&#x1F535; **Code Along**
**For Loop**
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const newNumbers = [];

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    newNumbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2;
}

console.log("The doubled numbers are", newNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

You can use `map` and specify what to do to your array:

**Map**
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const newNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
    return number * 2;
});

console.log("The doubled numbers are", newNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**Chain it!**

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const newNumbers = numbers.map((number) =>{
    return number * 2;
}).map(function(number){
    return number + 1;
});

console.log("The doubled and incremented numbers are", newNumbers); // [3, 5, 7, 9]
```
Every number is now doubled and has 1 added to it.

**Rules for map:**
- The amount of input elements is equal to the amount of output elements. You can't give `map` 4 values, and only receive 3 back. If the _source array_ has an X amount of elements, then the _resulting array_ will also have X elements.

- Every output element corresponds to the input element in the same position; they're never shuffled around.


&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use the this array to do the following: `nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`;<br>
2. Using `map`, divide all of the numbers in the array by 2.<br>
3. Using, `map`, subtract 1 from the new array.<br>
4. Return an array of these new numbers.

**Filter**
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const oddNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => {
    return (number % 2 !== 0);
});

console.log("The odd numbers are", oddNumbers); // [2, 6]
```

&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use this array to do the following: `nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`;
2. Using `filter`, return a new array with only the even numbers. 

**Chain it!**
What if we need to filter out data from an array and modify it? Here's how we could do it with a `for loop`. 

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const newNumbers = [];

for(var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if(numbers[i] % 2 !== 0) {
        newNumbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2;
    }
}

console.log("The doubled numbers are", newNumbers); // [2, 6]
```

## We can chain our higher-order functions

**Filter AND Map:**
```
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

var newNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => {
    return (number % 2 !== 0);
}).map(function(number){
    return number * 2;
});

console.log("The doubled numbers are", newNumbers); // [2, 6]
```

&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use the this array to do the following: `nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`;
2. Using `filter`, return a new array with only the odd numbers.
3. Use `map` to return an array where the numbers in the new array are multiplied by 10.

&#x1F34F; Fist to five! How are you feeling about filter?

## Reduce

**Syntax**<br>
`array.reduce(function(){}, value)`

The `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.

Note: the second parameter that is in the `reduce` function is the initial value that will be returned. For example, if there is a zero at the end of the function, you are starting with an inital value of zero and expecting a number to be returned. If you enter an empty array, then you're telling reduce to start with an empty array and return your results in an array.

What if we want to sum all the numbers in our array?

&#x1F535; **Code Along**

**For Loop**
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const totalNumber = 0;

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    totalNumber += numbers[i];
}

console.log("The total number is", totalNumber); // 10
```

**Reduce**
```
const sum = [0, 1, 2, 3].reduce(function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}, 0);
// sum is 6
```

Or you can set your array as a variable and call reduce on the variable:
```
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

var sum = nums.reduce((a, b) => {
  return a + b;
}, 0);
// sum is 6
```

**What's happening with when you reduce?**
I like to see exactly what is going on with the `reduce` property, so I'm console logging all of the values in my function to see what is happening each time it loops through:

```
nums = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6];

var sum = nums.reduce(function(a, b) {
  console.log("A is " + a);
  console.log("B is " + b);
  console.log("A + b = " + (a + b));
  console.log("////////////////////////")
  return a + b;
}, 0);
// sum is 6

console.log(sum);
```
***OUTPUT:***
```
// A is 0
// B is 0
// A + b = 0
// ////////////////////////
// A is 0
// B is 1
// A + b = 1
// ////////////////////////
// A is 1
// B is 3
// A + b = 4
// ////////////////////////
// A is 4
// B is 4
// A + b = 8
// ////////////////////////
// A is 8
// B is 5
// A + b = 13
// ////////////////////////
// A is 13
// B is 6
// A + b = 19
// ////////////////////////
// 19
```

It works like this:

- The second argument to the function call is considered to be the 'starting value' for the total - this is what you start out with.
- For each item in the array, it calls the callback, with the total value up to that point, and the item itself. For the first item, the 'total value' is the starting value.
- You return a new 'total value'. In this case, it's the sum of all previous numbers plus the current number. This return value is used as the 'total value' for the next item.
- After running out of items, the 'cumulative' total value is returned.

**Reduce can also work on an array of arrays:**

&#x1F535; **Code Along**

```javascript
const flattened = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduce((a, b) => {
  return a.concat(b);
}, []);
// flattened is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use the this array to do the following: `nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`;<br>
2. Using `reduce`, return the sum of the numbers.<br>
3. Use this second array of arrays to return an array that does not contain any arrays, only strings: `names = [['Mickey', 'Minnie'], ['Donald', 'Daisy'], ['Pluto']];`

**Chain it!**
What if we want to do something to our original array and then reduce it all down to one value?

&#x1F535; **Code Along**

***For loop:***
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const totalNumber = 0;

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    totalNumber += numbers[i] * 2;
}

console.log("The total number is", totalNumber); // 20
```

**Reduce and Map**
```
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

var totalNumber = numbers.map((number) => {
    return number * 2;
}).reduce(function(total, number){
    return total + number;
}, 0);

console.log("The total number is", totalNumber); // 20
```


&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use the this array to do the following: `nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`;<br>
2. using `map`, multiply each of these numbers by 10.<br>
2. Using `reduce`, return the sum of the numbers.


## forEach

**Syntax**<br>
`array.forEach(function(){})`

Perhaps you really do want a `for loop` - you're not transforming and returning any values, you just want to cause some kind of side-effect (eg. creating a DOM element). It would be nice if you could chain it at the end of a map/reduce/filter 'pipeline', and indeed you can! In steps the higher-order function known as `forEach`.


&#x1F535; **Code Along**

***For Loop:***
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

***forEach***
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach(function(number){
    console.log(number);
});
```


&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use this array to do the following: `nums = [2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10]`;<br>
2. Console log each number in the array and its index.

**forEach can be used on Objects**

```
const numbers = {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4};

Object.keys(numbers).forEach(function(key){
    let value = numbers[key];
    // console.log(key);
    console.log(value);
});
```

&#x1F34F; Fist to five! How are you feeling about forEach?

&#x1F535; **Activity**
1. Use this object to do the following: `matrix = {start: 10, end: 6, location: remote, type: wdi};`<br>
2. Console log each value in the object.<br>
3. On the next line, console log both the key and value.

**Chain it!**
Let's take an array of objects and print the values of the objects that meet a certain requirement. Here's an [example](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-chaining-the-array-map-and-filter-methods) where we can print out the name of the stock if the price of the stock is above one that we specify.

&#x1F535; **Code Along**
**forEach and Map**

```
const stocks = [
  { symbol: "XFX", price: 240.22, volume: 23432 },
  { symbol: "TNZ", price: 332.19, volume: 234 },
  { symbol: "JXJ", price: 120.22, volume: 5323 }
];

const filteredStockSymbols = stocks.filter(function(stock) {
  return stock.price >= 150.00;
}).map(function(stock) {
  return stock.symbol;
}).forEach(function(symbol) {
  console.log(symbol);
});

```

# Review


## LOOPING OVER OBJECTS

There are two way to loop over objects. You can use either way. Both ways involve looping over the object's **keys**.

Let's say we have a pokemon object:

```
const pokemon =  { name: "Charizard", HP: 68, attack: 130 }
```

<br>

## `for ... in` loop

Print each key:

```
for (let key in pokemon) {
  console.log(key);
}
```


<br>

Print each value:

To do this, use the key as a **variable** within the square brackets.

```
for (let key in pokemon) {
  console.log(pokemon[key]);
}
```

<br>

## `Object.keys()`

Object.keys() will return an **array of keys**

```
console.log(Object.keys(pokemon));
```

To print the values, use the key as a **variable** within square brackets.

```
const keys = Object.keys(pokemon);

for (let i=0; i < keys.length; i++) {
  console.log(pokemon[keys[i]]);
}
```

Unre-factored version:

```
for (let i=0; i < Object.keys(pokemon).length; i++) {
  console.log(pokemon[Object.keys(movie)[i]]);
}
```

<br>
<hr>


# Pokemon loop

Give the following pokemon:

```
const pokemon = { name: "Ivysaur", HP: 60, attack: 62 }
```

&#x1F535; **Activity**

* Use a **for..in** loop to print all the keys of the pokemon object
* Use a **for..in** loop to print all the values of the pokemon object

<br>

CHALLENGE

With the following array of Pokemon objects:

```
const pokemon = [ 
               { name: "Charizard", HP: 68, attack: 130 },
               { name: "Ivysaur", HP: 60, attack: 62 },
               { name: "Jigglypuff", HP: 45, attack: 20 },
               { name: "Mr. Mime", HP: 40, attack: 45 }
             ]
```

&#x1F535; **Activity**

* Use **Object.keys** loop to print all the values of the pokemon object.
