# Morning Exercise

## Setup

1. Navigate inside today's `student_examples` folder `w02d05/student_examples`
2. Create a folder called `responsive_mockups`
3. Navigate inside the `responsive_mockups` folder we need to create *three* folders that each have *two* files:
   >Folders: `responsive_one`, `responsive_two`, `responsive_three`
    
   >Files (for each): `index.html`, `style.css`

Let's do this in **two** lines from inside the `responsive_mockups` directory:

1. Create the folders
`mkdir responsive_one responsive_two responsive_three`

2. Create the files
`touch responsive_one/index.html responsive_one/style.css  responsive_two/index.html responsive_two/style.css responsive_three/index.html responsive_three/style.css`

## Directions

1. **In pairs** create these three mockups.

2. Only 1 of your will be writing code today (we'll go over this below), and that person should share the code with their parter in a direct message *as a Snippet in Slack* (or via Github) after the exercise has ended.

Note: Each mockup has a **full screen** view and a **mobile** view.

## Pair Programming
You will be pair-programming to solve today's morning exercise. Note that we will be doing this multiple times throughout the cohort, so you will all get a chance to be a driver and an navigator. Embrace the position that you have in the moment.

### Driver
- You will be the person who is **typing** during this exercise.

- You should share your screen with your partner. Before you code anything, you should **vocalize** what you are doing and ask your partner for their opinion.

- Share the code that was written (via Github or Slack) with your partner once the exercise has ended.

### Navigator
- You will be watching as your partner writes the code. It is your job to **be vocal** with your ideas, but you won't be dictating the code.

- You should think about it at a higher level and ask things like "How would this piece of code handle this type of situation?" and "What are we outputting?", or "What are we trying to achieve?"
