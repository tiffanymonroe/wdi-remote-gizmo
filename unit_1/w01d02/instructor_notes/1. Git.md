##  Describe what git is and what it does

- Git is just a tool that allows you to move project specific files from your "local" (or personal) computer to another internet-connected computer which is acting as a central location for your code.  This other computer is called a "remote repository."
- All other computers that want to contribute to this specific project, will use the same remote repository (central computer), but send files from their own local computers.

##  Explain the difference between git and other versioning tools

- In the old days, people would use FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to send their files to central computer
	- The issue:
		1. Two people (Person A, Person B) copy the same file from the remote repo at roughly the same time
		1. They both make changes
		1. Person A uploads their changes
		1. Person B uploads their changes, overwriting Person A's changes
- The next step was to create a locking mechanism
	- How it worked
		1. Person A would "check out" a file (like in a library)
		1. Person B would not be able to check out that file until it was checked back in
		1. Person A would make changes to the file and then check it back in
		1. Person B could now check out that file
	- The issue
		- Person B would have to wait for person A to finish with a file to start work on it
- The next step was tools like CVS and SVN
	- How it worked
		1. Both Person A and Person B could check out a file at the same time
		1. Person A modifies the file and checks it back in
		1. Person B modifies the file, tries to check it back in, but cannot
		1. Person B must re-check out the file that now includes the changes made by person A
		1. CVS/SVN will attempt to merge the changes together
		1. As long as the changes made by both Person A and Person B are on different lines, this will succeed
		1. Once the changes made by Person A have been merged with Person B's version of the file, Person B can now check in their file
	- The issue
		- If a person is not ready to check in a file, there is no way to keep track of the changes made to that file
		- If something goes wrong before checking the file back in, the user must, figure out what happened, go through an almost endless number of Undo commands in their text editor, or revert their file to version that is in the repository.  A lot of work could be lost
- Git functions just like CVS and SVN, but it adds a local repository
	- This allows a user to keep a log of their local changes before finally pushing everything back to the remote repository
	- The user can also travel "back in time" to previous states that have been saved locally, but not yet pushed to the remote repository.  This is great for when something goes wrong
	- The process:
		1. Add files whose changes you want to be logged
		1. Log the changes of the files that were added (called making a "commit")
		1. Once all commits have been made, and you're ready to send your changes to the remote repo
			1. "pull" any changes that have been made to the repo since you last synced your local repo with the remote repo
			1. "push" your changes to the remote repo.

##  Create a repository in github

1. Go to https://github.com/
1. On the right click the green button that says "New Repository"
1. Give the repo a name and click Create

##  Clone that repository

1. Once you've created the repo, you'll be taken to repo page
1. In the "Quick setup" section, copy and paste the https url
1. Go to a suitable location in the terminal (let's do `~/dev/`) and type `git clone ` and paste the https url (e.g.`git clone https://github.com/mahuntington/asdfasdf.git`)
1. You may need to enter your github password

##  Stage Files

Once you've finished making changes for the moment, it's time to tell git which files need to have their changes logged

- `git add specific_file.txt` will log all changes to the file specific_file.text
- `git add .` will log the changes to all files in the current working directory
- `git add some_dir/` will log the changes to all files in the some_dir directory
- `git add -A` will add all files in the local repo that have been modified

To see the status of which files are in th process of being committed use `git status`

##  Commit Files

Log the files, and give the log a description (or "message") so you can easily remember what was done

- `git commit -m "changed the database structure to allow for an email address for each user"`
- check your commits with `git log`

##  Push files

Push your changes to the remote repository

- `git push origin master`
- origin is the nickname of the remote repo.  Master is the name of the branch (covered later), this is usually master when you start out.

##  Pull changes from remote repo

Pull any changes others made to the repo into your local version of the repo

- `git pull origin master`

##  Add an ssh key to your github account

- When you get tired of always entering your github password, you can use the ssh URL (as opposed to the https URL) when cloning a repo
- You'll need to also add what's called an ssh to github https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/
- Now you can use the ssh url when cloning instead of https

##  Fork a repository

Open source software is popular because the source code for an open source application is available for viewing on the internet.  If you want to play around with the code of an open source app on github, you can simply fork the repo and make changes to it there.

1. Find the repo on github.com
1. In the upper right, click the `fork` button
1. Choose which user (or organization if you belong to any) should create the duplicated repo
1. Clone, add, commit, push as normal

##  Pull changes from original repo

Sometimes you want to get changes that have been made to the original repository

1. Add original remote repo with `git remote add upstream https://github.com/mahuntington/asdfasdf.git`
	- `upstream` is a conventional name, it can be anything, though
	- update the URL to that of the original repo NOT your fork
1. Pull with `git pull upstream master`

## Create an issue for the original repository

Sometimes you want to send messages to the maintainers of the original repository

1. Go to the original repo on github.com
1. Click on the "Issues" tab at the top
1. Click the green "New issue" button on the right
1. Enter a title and a comment
1. Click "Submit new issue"

##  Create a pull request to original repository

If you have made a change to your fork that you want to be integrated into the original repo, you'll have to ask the original repo owner to review and merge your changes into theirs.

1. Go to the original repo
1. Click the tab marked `Pull requests`
1. Click "New pull request"
1. Underneath "Compare changes" click "compare across forks"
1. For the "head fork" choose your fork.  Leave "base fork" as the original repo
1. Next to the "base fork" and "head fork" buttons are drop downs for which branch of your fork (compare) should be merged into which original repo branch (base).
1. Click "Create pull request"

##  Create a branch

- When working on a specific feature, it's generally a good idea to create a "branch"
- This is purely for organizational purposes
	- In general, the `master` branch is for finished features
	- If you are working on a feature, it's not complete, but you want to save those changes to the repo (perhaps it's the end of the day), you can use branches to keep your changes off the `master` branch
- To list all branches run `git branch`
- To create a new branch run `git branch newbranch`
- Switch to a branch using `git checkout foo`.  From now on, until you change branches again, all commits will be created on that branch

## Push a branch to the repo

- `git push origin newbranch` will push the currently active branch to the remote on a branch called "newbranch"
- in general, you should push a local branch to a branch on the remote repo with the same name

##  Merge a branch into another branch

Once you are finished with branch and want to merge it (usually back into master):

1. switch to the branch that you want to merge the new branch INTO (`git checkout master`)
1. merge the branch using `git merge newbranch`.  This will merge the `newbranch` branch into the currently active branch (usually `master`)
