## Part 1 - Spectacle
### Move windows with ease
- Spectacle helps you to move and resize your screens with the a few clicks on your keypad. You no longer have to waste time using your mouse to rearrange the size of the screen.
- Not only will this help to save you time, but it will help to add to the illusion that you are a bada$$ h4ck3r.

:computer: Click on this link https://www.spectacleapp.com/ and download Spectacle.

- Once it's downloaded, you should have little glasses ![spectacle](https://i.imgur.com/qyNXQn0.png) at the top, right of your screen.

- First change your computer's privacy settings to allow this application:
- To do this, in your Spotlight, type **Security & Privacy** and you should see this:

- Click on the lock in the bottom left:

- Click on Specticle to give it permission:

- Click on the lock again to save the changes:

- Now, click on the glasses at the top of your screen and select `Preferences`.

- Update your Spectacle Preferences to the following (Note especially: Full screen, right half, left half, bottom half)

## Part 2 - Command Line

### Be a lazy programmer
- You will find yourself having to re-run applications when testing your app or you will find yourself needing to retype certain lines over and over again. Be lazy! It will give you more energy for the important stuff.
- Open your terminal and let's try out a few of these.
    
#### Command Line Shortcuts

- Are you running the same command over and over again? Use the **up arrow** to show your previous commands. Hit **enter** to run them.


## Part 3 - Keyboard Shortcuts

### Shortcuts for any occasion!
- Here are the shortcuts that you will use most often:

## Part 4 - Atom
- Open Atom so that we can practice these
(open atom by clicking on the icon in your dock OR by opening your search `command + space` and typing `atom`).

### HTML Boilerplate
 - Every HTML document needs the same basic tags. There's an easy way to do this in Atom.
 - Type `HTML` and hit `tab`. The boilerplate will autocomplete.


### Split Screen
- If you have more than one file that you'd like to look at, you can go up to `View` and then choose how you would like your panes to be displayed. <br>

<br>
Or, you can drag a file and drop it where you want it (half vertical, half horizontal, etc.)<br>

### Wrapping Text
- You have a limited amount of visible space in your files, so wrapping your text will help you to see all the code in a line without needing to scroll horizontally.
1. Click on `Atom` and `Preferences`<br>

2. Select `Soft Wrap` <br>

3. Your long lines will now be wrapped. <br>

### Commenting Code
- Whether you're in an HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file, if you want to comment out your code (have the program ignore some lines of code), you can use one command.

- `Command` + `/`

### Indentation

- Code is indented to show parent/child relationships and emphasize hierarchy.

- When you have time, check out the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

- For now, let's ensure that your tabs are set currectly: Use soft tabs set to 2 spaces.

- Open Atom, go to Preferences, scroll down to ensure that tabs are set to 2.

- To make it easier to open our files, you can use the keyword `atom` in front of your files (or `atom .` to open all the files in the current folder). To do this, open Atom, click on Atom, and then click on Install Shell Commands. Restart your terminal.

### Tabs over spaces
When indenting your code, please use the tab button. Do not use your spacebar. Less clicking (keep it lazy, programmers :)) and increased consistency!
