## Student Handbook

## Emotional Framing

- Programming is not about learning a sequence of steps, it's about developing a mindset to solve problems and think programmatically.
- Language not important
    - critical/analytical/programatic thinking.
    - don't memorize, conceptualize ideas.
        - the internet is your notebook/memory
	- the movies make it seem like you just sit and type like a maniac
		- this is not the case
    - be able to adapt quickly
- Deal with chaos in your head. Being confused/lost is NORMAL. No one pays you because you know all the answers. The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution.
- Development can be very personal
	- Debugging your own mistakes
	- Being a good "Googler" and reading tech documents takes practice
	- You learn more by doing than by listening
	- We try not to hold your hand
		- There is a decent amount of failure that happens initially
			- good to get that out of the way before starting work
- Hard Work: 80-90hrs/wk minimum
- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.

- This experience is a rollercoaster.

## You Are Not Your Code!

- Be open and ready to receive constructive criticism
- Nobody writes perfect apps even in production, there is always something to improve
- Constructive criticism is not a reflection on you

## Classroom Culture

- Open safe environment
- Take ownership of your experience
- Check your ego at the door
- Empathy
- Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday
- You get what you put in

## Mentorship Culture

- Take care of each other
- Benchmarking; some are good at one thing, others at another. Leverage each other's strengths.
- Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept.
- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!

## Grit

- Jill's example is being used only because of the great photo.  Her story is not unique.
- This is like three months of "cramming for finals"
- So many co-workers in the industry have no brains but just work hard
- Recruiters have told me there's so much demand that they've placed felons

## How To Get Help

Instructors and IAs have specific times that they are available and are unavailable outside of those times.  For the sake of fairness to all students, we are not allowed to make exceptions to this rule.

- For lecture and labs, ask questions constantly
	- All instructors are available to you from 10am - 6pm (Eastern)
- For Homework, queue up with the evening TA
	- TA is available from 7pm - 10pm Mon-Thurs and 1pm - 4pm on Saturday (Eastern)
	- This will force you to do some debugging on your own, but it will also give you a quick resource if you're stuck
- Projects is your time to see what the real world will be like
	- the more time you spend fixing, the more you learn
	- receiving an answer stops the learning process
	- only ask a question if you've been stuck for about a day

## Projects

- Where the real learning happens
- If you don't finish the unit project, you will not pass the unit
  - Possible next steps:
    - Audit
    - Transfer
    - Withdraw
- Don't do the minimum to get by
  - Even if you technically hit all the requirements for a project, if it is clear all you did was the bare minimum, you might not pass
    - GA grads are passionate, we don't graduate people who just want to scrape by

## Plagiarism

### Statement

General Assembly takes academic honesty very seriously, and as such will not tolerate any student who plagiarizes in order to satisfy class requirements.  Programs at General Assembly are intensive, require a lot of work on the part of the student, and students will occasionally not be able to complete work in a timely fashion.  

Rather than rely on work that’s not your own to create the appearance of success, let your instructional team know as early as possible that you are not prepared for the work.  It is much easier to come up with a plan, than it is to succeed if you’ve been removed from the program.

### Definition

Plagiarism is the act of claiming that work that does not belong to you is in fact your own.  It can take many forms, and each concentration at General Assembly will have a slightly different guideline to identify plagiarism in their field.  

Generally it is safe to assume that if you are including work that does not belong to you in an effort to build on your own work — cite it.  If you are using work that does not belong to you as a replacement for your own work, you’re probably plagiarizing.

### Procedure

If an instructor is in doubt of a students work or has evidence of plagiarism, the student will be asked to justify the work they've submitted.  Should they be unable to show the work they have claimed as their own is in fact theirs, the student will face disciplinary action.  

On a first offense a student will be placed on probation and asked to produce new material conforming to the original assignment.  If a student is already on probation then they will be removed from the program they are in, and prevented from taking further classes at General Assembly.

In egregious offenses (presenting another student’s project, an external product, work you did before being a student at General Assembly, work contracted out to professional developers, etc.), disciplinary action should be escalated to removal from the program.
