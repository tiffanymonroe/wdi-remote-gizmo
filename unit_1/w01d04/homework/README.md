# Homework

## Setup
1) In the `homework` folder for tonight, create a file called `solutions.js`. Write your answers in this file.
<br>

## Functions

### Verbal questions

Write answers to the following questions as comments. As a reminder you can highlight your code and type `command` + `/` to turn your code into a comment.

```
// my commented answer
```
2. What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
3. Within a function, what is the difference between **return** and **console.log**?

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 1 - Verbal questions".
<hr>

## Palindrome
Write a function `checkPalindrome` that accepts a single argument, a string. The function should return true (Boolean) if the string is a palindrome, false if it is not. Make sure your function will give the correct answer for words with **capital letters**.

```javascript
console.log(checkPalindrome("Radar"));
 => true
```

```javascript
console.log(checkPalindrome("Borscht"));
=> false
```
<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 2 - Palindrome".
<hr>

## Digit Sum
Write a function `sumDigits` that accepts a number and returns the sum of its digits.
```
console.log(sumDigits(42));
=> 6;
```

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 3 - Digit Sum".
<hr>

## Pythagoras
Write a function `calculateSide` that takes two arguments: `sideA` and `sideB`, and returns the solution for sideC using the Pythagorean theorem.
  
_hint:_ discover the Pythagorean Theorem on a website called google.com  
_hint:_ checkout the [Math methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) in javascript
```
console.log(calculateSide(8, 6));
=> 10
```
<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 4 - Pythagoras".
<hr>

## Sum Array
Write a function `sumArray` that takes an **array** as an argument.
The array should contain numbers. The function should return the sum of the numbers in the array.
Use a _for loop_ within the function to iterate over the array and sum the contents.
Use a variable such as 
```javascript
let sum = 0;
```
that will **accumulate** value within the loop.
Expected result:
```javascript
console.log(sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]));
=> 21
```
<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 5 - Sum Array".

## Prime Numbers
A Prime number is a number that is not evenly divisible by another number except 1 and itself. If you want to read more deeply about it, [go here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).
To test whether a number is Prime, you only need to test as far as the **square root** of that number. This is advisable for optimization and testing large numbers.

### Step One
Write a function called `checkPrime` that will test whether a number is Prime. The function will return true (Boolean) if Prime, false if not.
_Hint:_ Check every number up to the square root. To do this, try a _for loop_.

### Step Two
Write another function called `printPrimes` that will print (console log) all the Primes up to an arbitrary limit. For example, if you invoke your function with `printPrimes(97)`, it will print all the Prime numbers up to and including 97.
This function can **call on** the previous `checkPrime` function.

The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 6 - Prime Numbers".
<hr>

## Insert Dash
Write a function `insertDash` that accepts a number as a parameter and returns a string with a dash inserted between any consecutive **odd numbers**. There should not be a dash at the end, it goes only between numbers.
```javascript
console.log(insertDash(454793));
```
> => 4547-9-3

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 7 - Insert Dash".
