Let's use some common HTML tags to create a website about for Grumpy Cat.

1) Inside your `morning_exercise` folder, let's create a file for this cat site. What should we name the file?
2) How do I make add the boilerplate needed for an HTML file?
3) How do I add a title to my file so that you can see the name on the browser tab?
4) How do I make a header?
5) What tag should I used to add a paragraph about our client?
6) How can I add a picture of the cat? Here's the link that I want to use: 
https://quelchenonsapevi.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0000-3.jpeg
7) How can I make a link to go to the cat's Twitter? Here's the link that the cat wants us to use:

## Directions
Look at the image below and create this webpage using HTML (no styling yet). Write your code inside the `mockup_practice` folder inside the file `index.html` that is inside your `morning_exercise` folder (so that is: `unit_01/w01d04/morning_exercise/mockup_practice/index.html`).

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to check your work in the browser *as you write your code*.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
Using the command `open index.html` inside the terminal when you are inside the folder with your `index.html` file will open your application in your browser.

## Commit Your Work

1. Get used to committing your work! After you create a tag, push the work.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
  - `git add .` to add the file
  - `git commit -m"add a message"` to make a commit
  - `git push origin master` to push it the work to your branch of the class github repo

## The Mockup

## The Resources
1. URL for image: http://blog.taxact.com/wp-content/uploads/Complete-Guide-to-Employee-Stock-Options-and-Tax-Reporting-Forms.jpg

1. For text to fill the paragraphs, use [a Lorem Ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/) (this is just one of many that you can use).

1. The links that you create do not have to go anywhere, but you should be able to click on them.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
Use a `#` to make a "dummy" link.

## Hungry for More?

1. Create an `about.html` file which has similar content to the index.  

2. Have the "About" link in the `index.html` file send you to `about.html`.

3. Have the "Home" link send you to the `index.html` page.

4. Add a `style.css` file, link it, and use what you know about CSS from Fundamentals to start styling this website.
