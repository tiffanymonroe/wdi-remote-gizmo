# Homework

## Setup
1. Inside your `homework` folder for tonight, create an `answers.js` file.
2. Write your answers in this file. Use comments for the non-code responses.

## Datatypes

### Refresher
So far we have seen:

* Strings
* Numbers
* Booleans
* Arrays
* Objects

When these datatypes are combined, we get a **data structure**, for example, an array that contains objects that each contain booleans.

Let's say you are tasked with creating some software, and it is up to **you** to determine which datatypes and what data structure to use.

### Answer the Following
For each of the following, write which **datatypes** you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the **data structure**:

1. A light switch that can be either on or off.
2. A user's email address.
3. A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
4. A list of student names from our class.
5. A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
6. A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.**<br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"1st commit - selecting datatypes".
<hr>

## Take it Easy

1. Make an array that holds all of the colors of the rainbow.
2. Write code that will access "blue" from the rainbow array.
3. Make an object that is called your name and holds the information about your favorite food, a hobby, the name of the town that you live in currently, and your favorite datatype.
4. Write code that will access your hobby from the object that you just created.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.**<br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"2nd commit - created some data structures and accessed some data".
<hr>

## Crazy Object!

```
const crazyObject = {
  taco: [{meat: 'steak',
         cheese: ['panela', 'queso', 'chihuahua']},
         {meat: 'chicken',
          salsa: ["pico", "hot", "hotter", "really hot", "really really hot", "omg my mouth is burning"]},
        ],
  larry: {
    nicknames: ["LD", "Chicken Teriyaki Boyyyyyy"],
    quotes: ["Pretty pretty prettayyyyy good", "Is that a parkinson's thing?", "women love a self confident bald man", "I'm a walking talking enigma"],
    characters: [{
      name: "Jeff",
      occupation: "manager"
    },
    {
      name: "funkhauser",
      occupation: "tv dude"
    },
    {
      name: "susie",
      occupation: "jeffs wife",
      favourtieHobby: "Swearing at Larry and Jeff"
    },
    ]
  }
}
```

Use crazy Object to log the following.

1. "omg my mouth is burning"

2. "Pretty pretty prettayyyyy good"

3. "Swearing at Larry and Jeff"

4. "Chicken Teriyaki Boyyyyyy"

5. The object the contains the name `funkhauser`

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"3rd commit - performed operations on the crazy object".
<hr>

# Object-ception

With the following object:

```
const inception = {
   reality: {
       dreamLayer1: {
           dreamLayer2: {
               dreamLayer3: {
                   dreamLayer4: {
                       dreamLayer5: {
                           dreamLayer6: {
                               limbo: "Joseph Gordon Levitt"
                          }
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
}
```

Change the value of `limbo` to `null`.

&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"4th commit - accessed limbo".

## Bond Films

### Array of objects:

```
const bondFilms = [
  { "title" : "Skyfall", "year" : 2012, "actor" : "Daniel Craig", "gross" : "$1,108,561,008" },
  { "title" : "Thunderball", "year" : 1965, "actor" : "Sean Connery", "gross" : "$1,014,941,117" },
  { "title" : "Goldfinger", "year" : 1964, "actor" : "Sean Connery", "gross" : "$912,257,512" },
  { "title" : "Live and Let Die", "year" : 1973, "actor" : "Roger Moore", "gross" : "$825,110,761" },
  { "title" : "You Only Live Twice", "year" : 1967, "actor" : "Sean Connery", "gross" : "$756,544,419" },
  { "title" : "The Spy Who Loved Me", "year" : 1977, "actor" : "Roger Moore", "gross" : "$692,713,752" },
  { "title" : "Casino Royale", "year" : 2006, "actor" : "Daniel Craig", "gross" : "$669,789,482" },

  { "title" : "The World is Not Enough", "year" : 1999, "actor" : "Pierce Brosnan", "gross" : "$491,617,153" },
  { "title" : "For Your Eyes Only", "year" : 1981, "actor" : "Roger Moore", "gross" : "$486,468,881" },
  { "title" : "Tomorrow Never Dies", "year" : 1997, "actor" : "Pierce Brosnan", "gross" : "$478,946,402" },
  { "title" : "The Man with the Golden Gun", "year" : 1974, "actor" : "Roger Moore", "gross" : "$448,249,281" },
  { "title" : "Dr. No", "year" : 1962, "actor" : "Sean Connery", "gross" : "$440,759,072" },
  { "title" : "Octopussy", "year" : 1983, "actor" : "Roger Moore", "gross" : "$426,244,352" },
  { "title" : "The Living Daylights", "year" : 1987, "actor" : "Timothy Dalton", "gross" : "$381,088,866" },
  { "title" : "A View to a Kill", "year" : 1985, "actor" : "Roger Moore", "gross" : "$321,172,633" },
  { "title" : "License to Kill", "year" : 1989, "actor" : "Timothy Dalton", "gross" : "$285,157,191" }
];
```

Yikes. Well, copy the bondFilms **array** of **objects** above into your js file. Use **for loops** and conditionals and methods in order to complete the below:

* Create a new array called `bondTitles` with only the titles of the Bond films, and console.log the new array.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"5th commit - Made an array of bond titles".
<hr>

* Create a new array `oddBonds`, of only the Bond films released on odd-numbered years.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"6th commit - made an array of odd bonds".
<hr>

* Determine the total cumulative gross of the Bond franchise, and console.log the result. _hint_ To make the grosses into usable numbers, look into the `.replace` Javascript method (there are many ways to do this, however). Look into `parseInt` also.

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"7th commit - determined the bond films gross".
<hr>

# Hungry For More?

CHALLENGE

`bondFilms` again!

- Console log the single movie **object** that contains the actor who starred in the least number of films.

Expected result:

```
{ "title" : "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", "year" : 1969, "actor" : "George Lazenby", "gross" : "$505,899,782" }
```

You should arrive at this result by comparing the frequency of actors.

_hint:_ Objects by definition have **unique** keys. Later in the problem you could create a new object wherein all the Bond actors are keys, and unique, with no doubles.

_another hint:_ You might come to a place where you will want to iterate over an object. You can iterate over arrays, but did you know you can iterate over objects?

You can either use `Object.keys()`, documentation [here - Object.keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)

Or, you can use a `for ... in` loop, documentation [here - for ... in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)

<br>

### More on `for ... in`

The syntax for iterating over an object with `for ... in` is:

```
for (let key in obj) {
	// stuff, such as console.log(key)
}
```

Where `key` is a variable that instantiates for the keys in object, and `obj` is the name
of the object you are iterating over. So, if you just wanted to console.log all the **keys** in the first bondFilms object, you could write:

```
for (let key in bondFilms[0]) {
	console.log(key);
}
```

Also remember, you can use a variable to access a key in an object, with bracket notation:

`obj[key]` will look for the property in the object that corresponds to whatever the
variable `key` is. This is very different to the syntax `obj['key']` (notice the quotes) that will look for a key _named_ key, rather than a variable.

To print all of the **values** in the first bondFilms object, you could write:

```
for (let key in bondFilms[0]) {
	console.log(bondFilms[0][key]);
}
```
Good luck!
