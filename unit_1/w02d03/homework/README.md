# Morning Exercise


## Directions
Look at the image below and create this webpage using HTML. 

## Setup
1. Navigate to your `student_examples` folder for today (`w02d01`).
2. **Create a folder**  called `morning_mockup`.
3. Navigate inside the `morning_mockup` folder and create an `index.html` file.

Your folder structure will look like: 
`unit_01/w02d01/student_examples/morning_mockup/index.html`

**IMPORTANT** As you code, make sure to check your work in the browser.

## Create This Mockup

## The Resources
1. Images are located in the `img` folder inside this `morning_exercise` folder. You can either reference to this foldeder or copy the `img` to your `morning_mockup` and reference from there.
    
1. For the "GET IN TOUCH" section, don't worry about creating form elements for name, email, subject, message, send.  Just use standard elements that we've learned about (maybe divs?) and then style them appropriately.

## Hungry for More:

1. Research form elements and add them in to match the mockup
1. Connect a CSS file to the HTML file and start changing the background colors.
1. Don't worry about matching the fonts exactly, but check out some [standard fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) in CSS or [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
