# Morning Exercise


## Directions
Look at the mockup below and create a webpage **with this layout** using HTML and the images provided (note, the images provided are not the same as the ones in the mockup).

**Important for today:**
- Get your HTML elements on the page.
- Think about which semantic tags you can use (`section`, `main`, `header`, `footer`, `paragraph`, which heading tags should you use?).

NOTE: This is a 2-day exercise.

## Setup
1. Navigate to your `student_examples` folder for today (`w02d03`).
2. **Create a folder**  called `morning_mockup`.
3. Navigate inside the `morning_mockup` folder and create an `index.html` file.

Your folder structure will look like:
`unit_01/w02d03/student_examples/morning_mockup/index.html`

**IMPORTANT** As you code, make sure to check your work in the browser.

## Mockup (for the structure)

## The Resources
1. You are being provided with 5 pictures (located in the images folder inside this `morning_exercise` folder.
1. For the "GET IN TOUCH" section, don't worry about creating form elements for name, email, subject, message, send.  Just use standard elements that we've learned about (maybe divs?) and then style them appropriately.

## Stretch:
1. Connect a CSS file to the HTML file and start changing the background color, moving images, etc.
1. Research form elements and add them in to match the mockup
1. Don't worry about matching the fonts exactly, but check out some [standard fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) in CSS or [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
