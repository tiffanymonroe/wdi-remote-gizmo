## Resources

1. Your main focus is on positioning the content. See the links below for guides on using Flexbox.
2. Images - You have been provided with all of the images that you need to create this mockup. Take a look at what you have before you begin.
3. Text - Feel free to use `lorem` in place of this real text. As for the font, save this for *last* step. You don't need the exact font - just choose something that looks similar.
