# Random Imgur

* Using jQuery, make a square div with the text "Add random image". Add a class to make the div square. Give it some color.

* The div should have `cursor: pointer` in its CSS, so that when the user hovers the cursor over the div, the cursor turns into a pointer thing.

* Make an array of six image urls in your js file. (strings)

* Make it so that when you click the "Add random image" div, one random image from your array will appear on the page.

* Make it so that each image is re-sized to the same proportions as the square div.

* Make it so the images are added horizontally (inline-block)

**stretch goal**

RESEARCH BONUS

* Make it so that when you click on one of the added images, it will be removed from the page.

## EXTRA STUFF


We can run any procedure we like we like with our clicks:

* Construct a horrible digital quilt
* Construct a pyramid made from triangles

1. EXTRA RESEARCH CHALLENGE: Add an input box and a button to your page. When the button is clicked, grab the value of the text inside the input box, and use that value as an argument in your `generateQuilt(NUM)` and `generatePyramid(NUM)` functions.

2. Make the **Virtual Rolodex** from the morning lesson if you haven't done so.
