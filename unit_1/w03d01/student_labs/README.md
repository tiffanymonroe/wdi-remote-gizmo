# Lab - Classes (Constructor Functions)

## Easy

- These are purposefully ambiguous
    - On your own, come up with attributes that are either public or private
    - Come up with methods
- As you go down the list, some classes might be able to inherit from previous classes you've already written

1. Create a constructor function for a person
1. Create a constructor function for a pet
1. Create a constructor function for a boat
1. Create a constructor function for an artist
1. Create a constructor function for a robot
1. Create a constructor function for a computer
1. Create a constructor function for a dog
1. Create a constructor function for a painter
1. Create a constructor function for a car
1. Create a constructor function for a laptop
1. Create a constructor function for a humvee
1. Create a constructor function for a smart phone
1. Create a constructor function for a baby
1. Create a constructor function for a fire truck
1. Create a constructor function for a bird

## Harder

1. Create a single factory object to generate robots
    - The factory should have an array of robots that it has generated
    - A robot should have a serial number, based on what index it is in the factory's robots array
1. Create a constructor function for computer factories
    - A factory should have a name attribute which is set by passing a parameter into the constructor function for the factory
    - A factory should have an array of computers that it has generated
    - A computer should have a serial number attribute, based on what index it is in the factory's computers array
    - A computer should have a maker name attribute, which the factory sets during generation
