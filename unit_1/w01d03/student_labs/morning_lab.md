# Morning Lab

## Directions

Use the file `morning_lab_solutions.js` to write loops, `if`, or `if, else` statements to complete the following questions. Some of the problems may require you to use a loop inside the conditional. Refer back to your class notes from today if you need help.

## Conceptual Questions

1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 
2. How do we change the value of a variable? 
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?

## Strings

1. Create a variable called `firstVariable`.
  - assign it the value of a string => `"Hello World"`
  - change the value of this variable to a number.
  - store the value of `firstVariable` into a new variable called `secondVariable` 
  - change the value of `secondVariable` to a string. 
  - What is the value of `firstVariable`?

2. Create a variable called `yourName` and set it equal to your name as a string.
  - Write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable `yourName` so that it returns a new string with them concatenated. 
  
>ex: `Hello, my name is Jean Valjean`
  
## Booleans
- Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operator that evaluates the expression to true. :wave:

```
  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kevin';
```

-  a _ b;
-  c _ d;
-  'Name' ___ 'Name';
-  a _ b ___ c;
-  a _ a ___ d;
-  e ___ 'Kevin';
-  48 ___ '48';

...


## The Farm
1) Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the variable `animal` is equal to `cow`.

2) Change your code so that if the variable `animal` is anything other than a cow, your should print out "Hey! You're not a cow."

## Driver's Ed

1) Write a variable that will hold a person's age.

2) Write code that will print out "Here are the keys", if the age is 16 years or older.

3) Change your code so that if the age is younger than 16, a message will print "Sorry, you're too young."

## Just Loop It
1) Write code that will print out all the numbers in the range 0 - 10.

2) Write code that will print out all the numbers in the range 10 - 4000.

3) Write code that will print out every other number in the range 10 - 4000.

## Let's get even
1) Print out the even numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100.

2) Adjust your code to add a message next to the even number that says: "is an even number".

>Example Output:
```
2 is an even number
4 is an even number
6 is an even number
```

## Give me Five
1) For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a `number`. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five.

>Example Output:
```
I found a 5. High five!
I found a 10. High five!
```

2) Add to the code from above to print out "I found a `number`. Three is a crowd" if the number is a multiple of three.

>Example Output:
```
I found a 3. Three is a crowd
I found a 5. High five!
I found a 6. Three is a crowd
I found a 9. Three is a crowd
I found a 10. High five!
```

## Savings account
1) Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 10 to a variable called `bank_account`.

>Check your work! Your banck_account should have $55 in it.

2) You got a bonus! Your pay is now doubled each week. Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 100 multiplied by 2.

>Check your work! Your banck_account should have $10,100 in it.


## Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
