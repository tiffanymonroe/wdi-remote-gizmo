## Part 1
#### Git / Github Review :octocat:

Push your work and pull the most up-to-date information from our class repo.

1) Navigate to your `wdi-remote-gizmo` folder.
2) Run the command `git status`

<hr>

### What do you see?

#### :+1: You're good to go!

>##### WHAT TO DO:
>`git pull upstream master`
> - *This will pull any updated materials from the instructor's github repo.*
<hr>

#### :space_invader: You're probably in the wrong folder or your remotes are in the wrong place

![wrong folder](https://i.imgur.com/rO1T95z.png)

>##### WHAT TO DO:
>Make sure that you are inside the class folder when you run your `git` commands. 
>
>Run `git remote -v` to confirm that you have your github repo connected to this folder.

<hr>

#### :space_invader: Untracked files

OR 

#### :space_invader: Uncommited files

>##### WHAT TO DO:
>`git add .`
> - *This tells **git** to track your work.*
>
>`git commit -m"message about your work"`
>- *This message will be associated with the works that have done since your last commit.*
>
>`git push origin master`
>- *This command tells git to push your work to the repository that you have listed as `origin` (this should be your forked version of the class repo on Github) and the `master` portion is referring to the master branch (the default for now)*

<hr>


#### :space_invader: Files are ahead on Github

>##### WHAT TO DO:
>`git pull origin master`
>
>**NOTE** You may need to type `:wq` on the next screen to proceed.
>
>You should now be able to push your local files to Github. Run `git status` to confirm that your local files are up-to-date.

<hr>

### :+1: Once you see clean status message:

If you see this message after typing `git status`:

>##### WHAT TO DO:
>1) Pull down the newest class information for today:
>`git pull upstream master`

### :+1: After You've Pulled Successfully

You may see a response that looks something like this (but this won't be exact):

## Part 2
#### Any Questions About Submitting Homework?

If you had any questions about how to submit your homework, ask! We're here to help clarify.


## Part 3
#### Acitvity: More about HTML Documents

### Objectives:
- UTF-8
- HTML Boilerplate
- Linking files in HTML via relative and absolute pathing (http/https only)

### Watch These Videos

 - [HTML Video 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxhXFpsN5I4&index=1&list=PLdnONIhPScST0Vy4LrIZiYKpFNoxgyH7J)  ~ 14 minutes
 - [UTF-8 : The Unicode Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4) ~ 9.5 minutes
 - [Why HTML seems to tolerate mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-csXdj4WVwA) ~ 10 minutes

### About HTML Boilerplates
Boilerplate is defined as a standard template of any kind that can be used without much modification.

**Lesson Objective**

Rather than trying to memorize the boilerplate, build one on your own and take the time to understand each component's function.

- HTML documents have some standard elements that are always included
  `<!DOCTYPE html>` 
  *Put at the top of the document, to declare that this is an HTML5 document*
  
  **Additional boilerplate tags include**
  
  - `<html>`<br>
  - `<head>`<br>
  - `<body>`<br>
  - `<meta charset="utf-8">`<br>
  - `<title>`<br>

#### Ask Yourself:
1) What is the function of the `<head>` and `<body>` tags? 
2) What kind of tags go inside each one? 
3) Where does the `<title>` tag go (`<head>` or `<body>`)? 
4) Where on the web page does the text inside the `<title>` tag appear?

Other things to think about:
5) What does `<meta charset="utf-8">` do? (hint see above video)
6) According to the above video about HTML, what could you guess would happen if you forgot the `<html>` tags?


### Make a Boilerplate

There are usually a few common elements that are included in most HTML sites, including folders (for organization), CSS files and JavaScript files. Let's add them, so you can have a boilerplate ready to go whenever you start a new homework or project.

<details><summary>File Structure</summary>

What it looks like in your terminal:

What it looks like in your browser (GUI):

</details>

#### Create files and folders
Note: I have a `boilerplate` folder already created within this morning's `morning_exercise` directory with the files and folders that you will need. Feel free to reference this.

Inside today's Morning Exercise folder:
1) Make a new folder (`mkdir`) called `project-boilerplate`
2) Navigate into the folder `cd project-boilerplate`

#### Make an HTML file

1) touch `index.html`

#### Make a JavaScript file
1) touch `app.js`
2) open `app.js` to edit the file in Atom `atom app.js`
3) make a `console.log` in the JS file so that you can verify that it is hooked up. So, on line 1 of your `app.js` file, write the code `console.log("My app.js file is attached")`.

Note: if you have more than one JavaScript file, it would be typical to put those files all in a folder called `js` (or a similar name  - see example with CSS)

#### Make CSS folder and file
- Createa  new folder for your css `mkdir css`
- Navigate inside the `css` folder and create a file called `style.css`
- Use Atom to edit your `style.css` file.
- Select the `body` and give it a `background-color` [of any color of your choosing](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
- Take a moment to think about how you can tell if you have successfully linked your stylesheet.

<hr>

#### Connect Your Files
1) Open your `index.html` in Atom (`atom index.html`)
2) Write your HMTL code (see above and refrence the videos). HINT: Atom has a built-in way to create an HTML boilerplate! On line 1 of your `index.html` file, type `HTML` and hit `tab`. Note: make sure that you do not put a space after `HTML`.
3) If you automatically made the tags, they should be tabbed and nested appropriately. If you wrote it from scratch, make sure to nest the tags to show the child / parent relationship.
4) Add a link to your `app.js` (where does it go? In the head? in the body?)
  - Check that it works by looking for the `console.log` that you added in the `Console` tab of your Inspector.
5) Add a link to your css (where does it go? In the head? in the body?)
  - Test it to be sure it works (how can you tell?)

#### Add a few more common elements

##### Image tag
1) Find an image on the internet that brings you joy
2) Copy its URL
3) Add an image tag  `<img/>` inside the body that will display your image
4) You will need to give the `<img/>` tag an `src` attribute and set its value to the image's url.
5) It is good practice to also add an alt attribute to an `</img>` tag. Why? What does this attribute do?

##### Heading Level 1 tag
1) Add an `<h1>` tag to describe the image you have added

###### Anchor tag `<a>`
1) Add an anchor tag `<a>` that links to a `#`. This will not take you anywhere, but gives the illusion of a link.

###### Paragraph & Questions
1) Use a paragraph tag inside your html and write a short answer to the following: Why were `<b>` (bold) and  `<i>` (italics) tags replaced by `<strong>` (strong) and `<em>` (emphasis) tags as the new standard in HTML 5?
