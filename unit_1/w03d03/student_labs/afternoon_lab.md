# Create a website from scratch using just jQuery

### Setup

* In **student_labs** for today, make a folder **jquery_practice**

* Inside **jquery_practice**, make files for:

* `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css`

* create the boilerplate HTML code in your`index.html`

* Get your app.js connected via the `script` tag. Put it in the `head`. Make sure a console.log will appear in Chrome console to test. (Open up Chrome js tools with `option âŒ˜ j`)

* Get your css connected via the `link` tag. Put it in the `head`. Change the body background to `azure` to test it. 

* Get the jquery library connected. Get the script tag with the **minified** version copied to your clipboard. `https://code.jquery.com/`

Put it in the `head`. But does it go above or below your app.js script tag? The order is crucial.

Test if the jquery library is available to your app.js by writing in a `$`.

There will be no error if jQuery is available to your app.js.

### Directions

Without writing any more code in your `index.html`, make a website with the following HTML structure using jQuery:

Remember the ids.

Inside the top container, create the following structure:

By either adding classes or by using `.css()`, make it so the three divs are red, white, and blue, with a width and height of 200px each, and inline block.

Make it so the bottom container has the following HTML structure, and displays any picture (from the internet) of 'Lumpy Space Princess'

<br>

* swap the positions of the top container and the bottom container

_Make sure that one is not inside the other in the Elements tab_

<br>

* change the image of lumpy space princess to any image of 'The Ice King', and change the title to 'The Ice King'

<br>

* Remove the container that holds the three colors and the text.


<br>

* Remove the container that holds the Ice King and the text.

<br>

* Add a paragraph to the empty page that says "the ice king waz here"
