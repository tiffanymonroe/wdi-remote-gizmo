### Create a website from scratch using just jQuery

* In `student_labs` for today, make a folder `jquery_practice`

* Inside `jquery_practice`, make files for:

* `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css`

* create the boilerplate HTML code `html [TAB]`


# Directions

Without writing any more code in your `index.html`, make a website with the following HTML structure using jQuery:

Remember the ids.

Inside the top container, create the following structure:

By either adding classes or by using `.css()`, make it so the three divs are red, white, and blue, with a width and height of 200px each, and inline block.

Make it so the bottom container has the following HTML structure, and displays any picture (from the internet) of 'Lumpy Space Princess'

<br>

* swap the positions of the top container and the bottom container

_Make sure that one is not inside the other in the Elements tab_

* change the image of lumpy space princess to any image of 'The Ice King', and change the title to 'The Ice King'
