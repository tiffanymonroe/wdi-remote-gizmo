# Bye, vanilla DOM

The 'vanilla' DOM commands are rather cumbersome, and we will not be using them. We have used them so far them just to - 

* Demonstrate that the HTML is represented as **JavaScript objects with useful methods on them** in the browser.
* Show you the DOM commands that are native to the browser
* Get you familiar with common patterns for interacting with the DOM.

We will be using the same patterns with jQuery, but we will be using a different syntax.

We can make our lives easier by using a **library** that will simplify the syntax for us.

# jQuery library

A **library** is just some third-party code we can reference in our projects. We don't ever need to look at the library code or tinker with it. It just sits there invisibly.


## Add jQuery Library to a project

**CDN**

`https://code.jquery.com/`

* Select the minified version of the latest jQuery
* Copy the whole script tag in the popup
* Place it _before_ your application script - that way, the jQuery code will have loaded before we try to use it.

**Main page - select minified jQuery**

**Copy the jQuery script tag and src**

**jQuery script placed before app.js in index.html**

![](https://i.imgur.com/HU9p8BK.png)

**Check if jquery is installed**

Type `$` in the Chrome console.

**Check if jquery is installed AND is available to your script**

Write `$` in your script file. If you get an error, jQuery is not available to your script, and you will have to debug the reason why.

Usually this is because you have placed your script file before your jquery file. 

jQuery file goes first. It makes sense that the jQuery code has to be loaded before you can use it.

## What is jQuery

jQuery:

* Is a _library_ of code that you include in the same way you include your own js scripts
* The browser loads in the jQuery code, which will allow us to use jQuery commands to interact with the DOM
* The library will **translate** our jQuery commands into ones that the browser will recognize as 'vanilla' js commands.
* Provides a _shorthand_ method of manipulating DOM elements.

<br>

## Use jQuery

When we write jQuery commands, the jQuery library translates our commands into ones that the browser will recognize as 'vanilla' JS. jQuery is a layer on top of the vanilla commands.

jQuery commands always begin with the `$` symbol

<br>

* **Grab an element by id**

```javascript
$('#idName');
```

Is translated into `document.querySelector` under the hood.

<br>

* **Grab an element by class**

```javascript
$('.someClass');
```

Is translated into `document.querySelector` under the hood.

<br>

* **Generate an element**

```javascript
$('<div>');
```

Is translated into `document.createElement()` under the hood.

<br>

* **Append an element to the body**


```javascript
$('body').append(someElement);
```

Is translated into `document.body.appendChild(someElement)`

<br>

**Add text to an element**

```javascript
someElement.text('the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides');
```

<br>

### Activity Setup

Open up `student_examples/dom_example` in text editor

Load `index.html` in browser

&#x1F535; **Activity (7 min)**

REFER TO THE [JQUERY CHEAT SHEET](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote-gizmo/blob/master/unit_1/w03d03/instructor_notes/jQuery_cheat_sheet.md)

* Add the jQuery library to your project
* Test that it is installed with `$` (refer to notes if necessary)

&#x1F535; **Activity**

* Create a div with jQuery
* Give the div some text with jQuery
* Append the div to the body of the page

&#x1F535; **Extra Activity**

* Create a `p` with jQuery
* Give the `p` a class of 'test-class' with jQuery
* Append the `p` to the previously created div (check in elements tab that it appended)

&#x1F535; **Extra Activity**

* Use jQuery to apply CSS to the `div`: make the div red using just jQuery

&#x1F535; **Extra Activity**

* Give the `p` an id of `test-id` using jQuery

# WINDOW ONLOAD

If you include the jQuery window onload in your script file, it will wait until the DOM has loaded before the script runs:

```javascript
$(() => {

	// code here will execute after the DOM has loaded

})
```

Using this technique, otherwise known as a `window onload`, you can place your scripts in the `head` of your `index.html`

You can either do this or put the script at the bottom, it doesn't matter too much at this stage. 

We might want to do this, however, to protect the **global scope** and move our code out of it. Code inside the window onload is not in the global scope.

<br>
<hr>

# DATATYPES

A common question is:

* Can I use jQuery and 'vanilla' JS in the same file?

The answer is yes. However, you shouldn't. For consistency, readability and testability, stick to either 'vanilla' JS _or_ jQuery.

Additionally, there is a risk of 'mixing datatypes' and coming up with annoying errors.

**jQuery objects are not native js objects**. You cannot mix your datatypes: 'vanilla' js commands cannot be performed on jQuery objects and vice versa.

**Example: Adding a class to a div:**


```javascript
const div = $('<div>');

div.classList.add('class');
```

This will not work because div variable is assigned to a jquery object, but classList.add is vanilla js.


```javascript
const div = $('<div>');

div.addClass('class')
```

This will work because `.addClass` is a jQuery method, and 'div' is a jQuery object. Match made.

* **vanilla js methods will not work on jQuery objects**

* **jQuery methods will not work on vanilla js objects**

# Add a `$` in front of jQuery variables


To make it explicit that your variables refer to jQuery objects, add a `$` in front of the variable. _This does not make it a jQuery object_, it merely clarifies, for us, that it is pointing to one:

Creating a div:

```javascript
const $div = $('<div>');
```

`$('<div>')` is a jQuery object, so we will use a `$` in the variable name: `$div`.

Grabbing all elements with class of 'square':

```javascript
const $classOfInfo = $('.info');
```

# jQuery commands - research!

Use the [jquery cheat sheet](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote-gizmo/blob/master/unit_1/w03d03/instructor_notes/jQuery_cheat_sheet.md)

OR Google, OR the [official docs](https://api.jquery.com/)

Answer and test - what jQuery command would I use to:

* Get all elements with class 'info'

* Create an 'img' element

* Give my 'img' a 'src' attribute

* Append my 'img' to the body of my page

* Give my 'img' an id of 'example'

* Give all elements with class 'info' an additional class of 'red'

* Get an element with an id of 'container'

* Remove an element with id of 'container'

<br>

# DOM patterns

**Demo - do not code along**

Let's reinforce our DOM creation patterns.

Let's make a third 'section' like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/W9l21Ir.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/RThOwoR.png)


**Create my elements first**

* Make a section and give it a class 'info'

```javascript
const $section = $('<section>').addClass('info');
```

* Make a p and give it some text

```javascript
const $p = $('<p>').text('Here be some drainage');
```

* Make an img and give it an attribute `src` with the property of the image url

```javascript
const $img = $('<img>').attr('src', 'http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/ABS/PublishingImages/2010-1155_00013525_10790.jpg');
```

**Then put the elements together**

* Append the p and the img to the section

```javascript
$section.append($p);
$section.append($img);
```

* Append the section to the container

```javascript
$('#container').append($section);
```

* Oops! We forgot the give the img an id:

```javascript
$img.attr('id', 'third-image');
```

**Give it some zhoozh**

* Change the css

```javascript
$('#container').css('background', 'firebrick');
```

```javascript
$('.info').css('color', 'white');
``` 

<br>

**Activity**

Using your folder and files from this morning, do the following:

* Add a section to the page with jQuery.
* The section should have a class of 'info'
* The section should contain a `p` with text
* The section should contain an `img` with an id `third-img`

* Change the css of the container so that the background-color is `firebrick`

* Change the css of the `info` boxes so that font has color `white`

# NOTES

## Selection Recap

To select by ID, you use the same syntax as CSS selectors

```javascript
$('#first-img');
```
> Select the element with id="first-img"`

To select all elements of a particular class, use CSS syntax again

```javascript
$('.info')
```

> Selects all elements of the class "info"`


<br>


#### Selecting an element and changing its content - vanilla vs jQuery

In this HTML:

```html
<div id="myDiv">Hello world!</div>
```

Here is a `vanilla` JS command:

```javascript
const divToManipulate = document.getElementById('myDiv');
divToManipulate.innerHTML = "Goodbye world!";
```

In jQuery, this is a one-liner:

```javascript
$('#myDiv').html("Goodbye world!");
```

There are two things about the example above that make jQuery easier to use:

  1. jQuery is using the same syntax as CSS to select elements

  2. jQuery allows us to chain methods together to accomplish our goals (i.e., $`().html(...)` ), making code shorter and easier to understand

<br>

#### Appending a DOM element to a page

If we want to add a new DIV with a P within it, that also has some text within it, our vanilla JavaScript would have to be:

```javascript
    const myDiv = document.getElementById('container');
    const newP = document.createElement('p');

    newP.innerText = "Hello complicated, multi-step world of adding an element to the DOM!";
    myDiv.appendChild(newP);
```

And in jQuery, it looks like this:

```javascript
	$('#container').append("<p>").text("Hello simple insertion using jQuery chaining");
```

In the jQuery code example above, we first select the DIV with `id="container"`, then we append a new paragraph element (automatically created using core jQuery selector function), and then we append the text we want to insert to the new paragraph element we just created.

<br>

#### Modifying Styles (CSS) Using jQuery

You can do more than select elements and modify content. You can also create or update CSS style attributes in jQuery using the `.css()` method

```javascript
$("#container").css("color", "red");
```

The code above will change the color of all text inside the DIV with id="container" to red.

Or, if we have a bunch of elements that all have the same class (in this example, it's class="info"), we can use the class selector to modify the color of all of them at once:

```javascript
$(".info").css("color", "blue");
```

<br>

#### Modifying an element with more than one line of CSS

To use `.css()` with more than one line of CSS to add, the syntax is slightly different. We put all of our CSS commands into an object:

```javascript
$("#container").css({ 'background-color':'cornflowerblue', 'font-size':'30px' });
```

However, it's usually better to change the css of an element by adding an existing class.


#### Adding a class

An existing class within `style.css`

```javascript
.hotpink {
  font-size: 90px;
  color: #ff69b4;
  background-color: red;
}
```

Add it with jQuery:

```javascript
  $("#container").addClass('hotpink');
```

<br>

#### Removing Elements Using jQuery

`.remove()` will remove an element and all its contents.

`.empty()` will remove all the content from an element, but the element will remain.

<br>

#### jQuery arrays and `.eq()`

When you return a jQuery object that contains many other jQuery objects, such as a list of elements with same class, you will get back an array.

But _be careful_ because if you try to access it like an ordinary array using brackets, the object will revert to a 'vanilla' one.

```
  const infoElements = $('.info');

  infoElements[0].text("Heeey!");
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/hhCogRU.png)

To maintain its 'status' as a jQuery object (and not convert it to a 'vanilla' one), use `.eq()`.

```
const infoElements = $('.info');

infoElements.eq(0).text("Heeyeeee");
```

* Use `.eq()` to select jQuery 'array' elements.

<br>

#### Selecting an element with jQuery should not be confused with creating one


This is the basic syntax for jQuery selections: `$(' ')`

To select a particular element by tag

`$('section') // selects all section elements`

This is the basic syntax for jQuery creations: `$('<  >')`

`$('<section>')` **creates** an element. Note the use of the pointies.

Not to be confused with each other!
