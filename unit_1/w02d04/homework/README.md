# Homework

Before starting this homework, please read this set of [Tips and Tricks](../instructor_notes/TIPS.md)

## Setup

1. Create a file called `answers.js` inside your `homework` folder for today.
2. Copy the questions that you are answering into your file (and comment it out) and write the answer below the question.

## Combine objects, arrays, and functions

**COMPLETE ANY 3**

1. Create an object that has a property that is an array. Log one of the elements of that array.
1. Create an object that has a property that is an object. Log one of the properties of that inner object.
1. Create an object that has a property that is a function (method).  Call that method.
1. Create an array that has an object in it.  Log one of the properties of that object.
1. Create an array that has an array as one of its elements.  Log one of the elements of the inner array.
1. Create an array that has a function as one of its elements.  Call that function.
1. Create an object that has a property that is an array. Loop over the array and log each individual element.
1. Create an array that has an array as one of its elements.  Loop over the second array and log each individual element.
    - Bonus: make each element of the outer array an array as well.  Using two for loops, loop over each array in the outer array and log those elements.

**Commit 2** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 2 - Combine objects, arrays, and functions more than one level deep"
<hr>

## Create a callback

1. Define two functions and set them to variables
1. The second function takes a parameter
1. Call the second function, passing in the variable that references the first function as the parameter
1. In the definition of the second function, invoke (call) the parameter that is being passed into it.  Remember, this parameter is a function

**Commit 3** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 3 - Create a callback"
<hr>

## Indentation

Correctly indent the following code:

```javascript
            if(true){
    const a = 2 + 2;
console.log(a);
        }

    if(true){
if(false){
            console.log('hi');
    }
                }
```

**Commit 4** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 4 - Indentation"
<hr>

## Semantic naming of variables

Fix this variable to have a better name:

```javascript
const c = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
```

**Commit 5** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 5 - Semantic naming of variables"
<hr>

## Function definition placement

Clean up this code, so that it works and has function definitions in the correct place

```javascript
bar();
const bar = ()=>{
    console.log('bar here');
}
foo();

const foo = ()=>{
    console.log('foo here');
}
```

**Commit 6** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 6 - Function definition placement"
<hr>

## Commenting code

Write your own comments for each line of code:

```javascript
const addTwoNums = (firstNum, secondNum)=>{
    const finalValue = firstNum + secondNum;
    return finalValue;
}
```

**Commit 7** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 7 - Commenting code"
<hr>

## Describe some common programming principles

Read this article (don't worry it's short): http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531

## Error reading

What is meant by the error this produces?

```javascript
foo();

const foo ()=>{
    console.log('hi');
}
```

**Commit 8** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 8 - Error reading"
<hr>

## Using the Javascript Debugger

- Debug the following code in node and in the browser.
    - Node: `node debug filename.js`
    - Browser: load it into an html file and open the html file in the browser with the Chrome dev tools enabled (Inspect)

    ```javascript
    const a = 2 + 2;
    debugger
    console.log(a);
    debugger
    a *= 2;
    debugger
    a--;
    ```

- Jump from one debugger statement to the next
    - Node: `c`
    - Browser: blue play button

- Examine the variable `a` each time you jump to a new statement
    - Node: `repl` and then type the variable
    - Browser: type the variable in the console

## Coerce data types

Fix the following code so the log executes (don't change the `if` statement):

```javascript
const b = '5';

if(b === 5){ //will be false
    console.log('this line should execute');
}
```

Fix the following code so the value 10 is logged (change only the line that has the console.log on it):

```javascript
const a = '5';
console.log(5 + a);
```

**Commit 9** <br>
<hr>
&#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 9 - Coerce data types"

# Style Zoo

In this homework we will be using basic HTML and CSS selectors to style a list of animals in our zoo.

## Setup

1. Make a folder inside your `homework` folder for today called `style_zoo`
2. Navigate inside your `style_zoo` folder and **create a file** called `index.html`.
4. **Create another file** inside the `style_zoo` folder called `style.css`.
5. Connect the CSS file to your HTML file.

#### Need a refresher on how to connect your CSS to your HTML?
   - Place a link tag inside the `head` section of your HTML file that refers to your css file:    
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

## Create Your Zoo

### Create the HTML

- Make a list of animals!
- Create an HTML file with a boilerplate.
- Add an unordered list of the following animals:  
    * mouse  
    * canary  
    * penguin  
    * salmon  
    * cat  
    * goldfish  
    * dog  
    * sheep  
    * parakeet  
    * tuna  

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 10 -  initial HTML setup".

### Add Classes and IDs to the Animals

Based on your knowledge of these animals, assign the following:

1. Class `mammal` to all the mammals.
2. Class `bird` to all the birds.
3. Class `fish` to all the fish.
4. ID of the name of the animal to each of the animals (ex: `<li class="fish" id="tuna">tuna</li>`)

<hr>
&#x1F534; **Commit your work.** <br>
The commit message should read: <br>
"Commit 11 -  classes and IDs added to HTML".
