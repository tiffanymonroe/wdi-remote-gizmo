# Homework

Layout [Oscar's website](https://www.hioscar.com/).

- You might notice that the site changes layout depending on the width of the browser.  Ignore this for now.  Just mimic how the site looks when it fills your monitor's width
- The images are in the [images/](images) directory
- Don't worry about icons like facebook, twitter, youtube, instagram.  As a stretch, use the inspector to see what they did and try to copy it
- Don't worry about all the little animations and changes that the site does when you roll over certain aspects of it
- The header stays in place as you scroll down.  For now just have it stay in place.  If you want, see if you can get that to work
- Don't worry about the fonts the site uses.  Just use `font-family: Arial` or `font-family: Times New Roman`
- Don't worry about rounded corners of buttons.  If you can figure it out, great!
- It's fine to guess at the colors
