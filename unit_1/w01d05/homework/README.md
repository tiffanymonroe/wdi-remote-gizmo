<details><summary>Hungry for more?</summary>

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price
