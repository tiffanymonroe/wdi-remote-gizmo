1. You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
1. Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1.  You can do this as much as you want.

    <hr>
    &#x1F534; The commit message should read: <br>
    "Commit 1 - Landscaper App: user can use teeth to cut grass"
    <hr>

<details><summary>Hungry for more?</summary>

1. Add the ability to reset the game at any point so that you can play again
1. Make it so that a user can have multiple tools, and money earned each day is increased appropriately (e.g. 2 scissors, and an old-timey push lawnmower means you earn $60/day )
1. Once you've implemented multiple tools, make it so you can sell tools for half price
