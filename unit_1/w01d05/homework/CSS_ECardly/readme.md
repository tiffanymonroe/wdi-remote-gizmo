# CSS Homework - ECardly

## Objectives
* More reps building webpage from an image
* Specifically reps styling a page, not worrying about positioning.

Included in your starter folder, please find a .png file of what our website is supposed to look like.  Also, included is an index.html and the necessary assets and stylesheets needed to make our page.  Here are some steps to get you started.

NOTE: Please make your CSS changes to style.css in the area between "Base Style" and "Layout".

### Body

* The `<body>` should have a background of the background.jpg provided for you in images.  The image should repeat only going left and right.  The rest of the page should have a background of #d6d6d6. (Hint: define the background image repeating in only one direction AND the background color on the same line).

* The `<body>` has a default font of Helvetica with font size of 12px.

* Define a line height for the body of 1.7.  This gives every line of text .35 padding above and below it.
