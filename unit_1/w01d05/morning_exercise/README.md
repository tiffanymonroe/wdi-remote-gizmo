# CSS Refresher - Group Activity
### Grumpy Cat

![grumpy cat](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/98/98f9148accd765ffd0e6d2dc052c83e05805138b05f5f85f462c6fb0413ef731.jpg)

Let's use some CSS to improve our website for Grumpy Cat.

1) Inside your `morning_exercise` folder, create a new directory called `grumpy_site`. 
2) Navigate inside `grumpy_site` and let's copy the files that we worked on yesterday and save them to our current location:
 `cp ../../w01d04/morning_exercise/index.html .`
3) Create a new file called `style.css`
4) How do we connect the CSS and HTML files?
5) How can we check to make sure that they're connected?
4) How do I make a header change the font for the header?
5) What can I do to add some margins around the paragraph about our client?
6) How can I change the size of the picture of the cat?
7) How can I change the color to on the link that goes to the cat's Twitter? 

# Activity

## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](https://i.imgur.com/XLnBkER.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
You already created the HTML for this mockup yesterday. You should have created it in your `w01d04/morning_exercise` folder

To copy your work into
`/w01d05/morning_exercise` folder

- In terminal:
 - navigate to your `/w01d05/morning_exercise` folder
 - from there type `cp ../../w01d04/morning_exercise/*.html .`
 - This command will copy all `html` files from yesterday's folder into today's morning exercise folder

 Note: if you have created your files elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path.

## Stretch:

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Fix the margins, font, layout, etc. to make this site look more professional!
