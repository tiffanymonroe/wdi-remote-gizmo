## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](mockup.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
You already created the HTML for this mockup yesterday. You should have created it in your `w01d04/morning_exercise` folder

To copy your work into
`/w01d05/morning_exercise` folder

- In terminal:
 - navigate to your `/w01d05/morning_exercise` folder
 - from there type `cp ../../w01d04/morning_exercise/*.html .`
 - This command will copy all `html` files from yesterday's folder into today's morning exercise folder

 Note: if you have created your files elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path.

## Stretch:

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
