# CSS Refresher - Group Activity
### Grumpy Cat

![grumpy cat](https://www.askideas.com/media/51/Smiles-Are-Contagious-Dont-Worry-I-Am-Vaccinated-Funny-Grumpy-Cat-Meme-Image.jpg)

Let's use some CSS to improve our website for Grumpy Cat.

1) Inside your `student_examples` folder, create a new directory called `grumpy_site`. 
2) Navigate inside `grumpy_site` and let's copy the files that we worked on yesterday and save them to our current location:
 `cp ../../../w01d04/morning_exercise/index.html .`
3) Create a new file called `style.css`
4) How do we connect the CSS and HTML files?
5) How can we check to make sure that they're connected?
4) How do I change the font for the heading?
5) What can I do to add some margins around the paragraph about our client?
6) How can I change the size of the picture of the cat?
7) How can I change the color of the text for the link that goes to the cat's Twitter? 

# Activity

## Create This Mockup
 ![Mockup](https://i.imgur.com/XLnBkER.png)
- Using what you learned about CSS, style the HTML lab so it looks like the mockup.

## Getting Started
1) You already created the HTML for this mockup yesterday. You should have created it in your `w01d04/morning_exercise` folder. We called it `index.html`. 

2. Let's copy your work into your `student_examples` folder for today. 

- In terminal:
 - navigate to your `/w01d05/student_examples` folder
 - create a new file called `morning_mockup`
 - navigate inside `morning_mockup`
 - from there type `cp ../../../w01d04/morning_exercise/mockup_practice/*.html .` NOTE: if you created more files than this (like a CSS file), you will also need to copy those files.
 - This command will copy all `html` files from yesterday's folder into today's `student_exercise` folder

 Note: if you have created your files elsewhere, you will need to adjust the path.

## Stretch:

1. Create/style the About page mentioned in the Stretch section of the HTML lab.
2. Fix the margins, font, layout, etc. to make this site look more professional!
