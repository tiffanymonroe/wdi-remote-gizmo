# Final Projects

## Outline

During your final weeks, you will be building two projects. One will be a Portfolio site and the other will be your most ambitious and exciting project for this course!

Before you begin, note that this will be your pièce de résistance and your goal will be to make it **AMAAAAZIIIING**.  These will be the sites that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

## Requirements

### 1. Portfolio Site

Create a site that shows off your work

- Suggested to be created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- No templates are permitted. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Bourbon, etc. are okay, but templates like WordPress, Hugo, Wix, Weebly, Squarespace etc. are **not** okay. If you aren't sure about it, ask an instructor.
- Deployed to github pages or hosted somewhere else
- Contains a list of your current projects
- Contains your resume
- Contains your bio
- Contains a link to your github profile
- Contains a link to your LinkedIn account
- Must be functional for all screen sizes (responsive)
- Optional / nice touch: Contains a list of links to various sites in the tech world that you follow
- <details><summary>Optional / nice touch: hire a designer to design your site</summary>
  - Possible places to find a designer:
    - https://www.freelancer.com/

    </details>
- Optional: Is linked to a purchased URL (possibly your name (.com)).

### 2. Final Project

It's time to shoot for the stars and build an extraordinary final project for this course!

Your final project should be an app that

- has an idea and technical stack (including database and server) that will be approved by the instructional team before you begin
- Is hosted somewhere on the internet
- Project info filled out in the google presentation sheet. This will be made available a few days before the project due date

<hr>

## Project due date
**Wednesday, September 27**<br>
Submit an issue (as you normally do for homework) with links to your repos AND links to your live sites. You will be presenting your projects in front of the class. The title for your issue should be `Your Name - Final Projects`

## Attendance
You are required to be present at 10:00 am EDT each day during the project. We will be taking attendance at this time.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:00 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:
- What did I work on yesterday
- What am I trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time_

**Wednesday, September 13**<br>
- Projects are announced
- Create new Github repos outside of your class repository (also, don't forget to make a `.gitignore` file)
- Create your user stories and add them to your README.md
- Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
- Make wireframes and add them to your README.md (or put images and add links)
- Create your daily tracker

**Thursday, September 14**
- You will have a 15 minute meeting with an instructor to get your project approved.

**Friday, September 15 through Monday, September 25**<br>

- There will be optional topics taught during some of the remaining mornings (schedule to be announced).

- During these weeks, there will be occasional 15 minute meetings to check in with instructors. We will do things like check your overall progress and direct you to resources.

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* At **least** one Github commit per day
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in  each of your github repos
* Due to the open-ended nature of this final project, each project will have additional MVPs that are agreed upon by the instructional team


ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

  * Is ~5-10 minutes in length
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make

  ---


  ### Suggested Ways to Get Started

  <details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

  * **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

  <br>

  * **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

  <br>

  * Create your **user stories**

  <br>

  * Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

  <br>

  * **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

  <br>

  * Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

  <br>

  * **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

  <br>

  * **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

  <br>

  * **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with our class TA
4. Submit a Github issue **on the class** Github account to receive help from an instructor.

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for the class repo to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submitting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **ALERT YOUR INSTRUCTOR**
- You must do @your_instructors_github_handle, inside the comment area of your issue, to notify your instructor that you have created an issue.

2. **LINKS**
- Links to your code and your live site.

3. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

4. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relevant code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

5. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

6. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
