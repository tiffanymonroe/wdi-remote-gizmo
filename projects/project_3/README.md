# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #3: MEAN Stack - Group Project

## Overview

For your 3rd project, you will be collaborating to make an application using the MEAN stack.

Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**, but you'll have partners to help you carry the load.

## Project due date
**Friday, August 25th at 10 am Eastern**<br>
Submit an issue (as you normally do for homework) with a link to your repo AND a link to your live site. You will be presenting your projects in front of the class.

NOTE: Only one person will need to submit the issue. The title for your issue should be `Your Names - Project 3`.

Also, be sure to add your project to the [Project 3 Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BDYu_h-ejdhGK7OExtKRv8nO5drGDS91jAgs3rkzMNU/edit#gid=0).

## Attendance
You are required to be present at 10:00 am EDT each day during the project. We will be taking attendance - this will count for both morning and afternoon attendance.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:00 am EDT **with your group** where you will answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday
- What am I trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Zoom
The class Zoom room will close around 10:30 am each day during project week (enough time for attendance and standup). Your group must decide how and when they would like to work together. Some groups choose to make a Zoom room of their own and work together (sometimes silently, sometimes in a pair-programming fashion to solve problems). Other groups decide to skip the Zoom hangouts and just work on their own. As a team, it is up to you all to come to an agreement on how you would like to work - feel free to adjust throughout the project.

Note: Your personal Zoom rooms only stay open for about 40 minutes at a time. You will have to make a new room after 40 minutes, so just prepare for this.

## TA Hours
There will **not** be daytime TA hours during project week. TAs will be available for help in the evenings during their regularly scheduled hours. During group project weeks, it is important to work together to solve problems.

## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time_

**Friday, August 18th**<br>
- You will have a 15 minute meeting with an instructor in the afternoon to get your project approved

**Monday, August 21 - Thursday, August 24**<br>
This varies depending on instructor, but you will have check-in meetings via Slack or Zoom. During this time we will check your tracker, overall progress, and direct you to resources.

## What you should be doing today
- Meet to discuss your ideas with your teammate(s) and choose one idea (remember, you can always use other ideas for your next project(s))
- Create a new Github repo *OUTSIDE* of your class repository.
- Create your user stories and add them to your `README.md`
- Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
- Make wireframes and add them to your `README.md` (or put images and add links)
- Create your daily tracker
- Read the [working in groups](working_in_groups.md) document in this project folder.

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

- A working full-stack application, built by **you & your group members**
- Use the MEAN stack: **Mongo**, **Express**, **Angular**, **Node**
- Your app should **consume an API** (your own, a third party, or both)
* A **git repository** hosted on Github.
* At **least** one Github commit per day per member showing frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* A **daily tracker** that all group members use (Trello, github issues, or another similar tracker), that can be reviewed by the instructional team
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via **Heroku**
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in your github repo

Lastly, a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

  * Is ~5-10 minutes in length
  * All group members should speak during the presentation
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make

Additionally, we would like each group member to answer **at least one** of the following questions:

1) What went well for your group?
2) What was your groups biggest struggle?
3) What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most
4) What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didn’t anticipate

---
### &#x1F535; Not mandatory:
#### Recommended features

* **Include portfolio-quality styling**
* **Use a CSS framework** like skeleton or bootstrap
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process (uploaded to your github repo)
* A `readme.md`file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc
* **Use a data visualization library** like D3

### Important note about APIs!

When you are calling APIs that require a key, it's up to you to store those keys somewhere private. They are the only proof that you are you and you are allowed to call that API, after all.

For example, it is very important that you not push your API keys to a public Github repo.

This is especially true when working with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's an example of a [stolen key horror story](https://wptavern.com/ryan-hellyers-aws-nightmare-leaked-access-keys-result-in-a-6000-bill-overnight).

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

<details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

<br>

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

<br>

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

<br>

* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given several days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

<br>

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

<br>

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

<br>

* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available.

## Make a new repo and set up your files for Heroku Deployment
Take the following steps to ensure you have the right file structure/set up in order to deploy your site to Heroku:

1. One group member will make the github repo **outside** of our class repo (this will be the *owner*). 

2. Inside this new repo, create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the repository directory. Put `node_modules` as the content of this file. Do this *BEFORE* the first `git add .` `git commit -m ''`

3. on `npm init`, specify `server.js` as your entry point

4. if you did not set up your `entry point` in `package.json` correctly, make sure that you edit your `pacakge.json` so that `main` is set to `server.js`

5. Make sure your `server.js` and `package.json` are in the **root** of your project repository.

6. The *owner* should add other members of the group as *collaborators* under the `Settings` tab of the repo. 

7. Collaborators should clone the repo.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with our class TA
4. Submit a Github issue **on the class** Github account to receive help from an instructor.

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for the class repo to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submitting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **ALERT YOUR INSTRUCTOR**
- You must do @your_instructors_github_handle, inside the comment area of your issue, to notify your instructor that you have created an issue.

2. **LINKS**
- Links to your code and your live site.

3. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

4. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relevant code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

5. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

6. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
