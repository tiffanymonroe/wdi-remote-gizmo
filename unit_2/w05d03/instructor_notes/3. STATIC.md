# Static Files

## Lesson Objectives

1. Define middleware
1. Create a static files folder for CSS/JS

## Define middleware

We can have a function execute for all routes:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('I run for all routes');
    next();
});
```

- This is called 'middleware'
- It runs in the middle of the request response cycle (in the middle)
    - sometime after the request is received, but before the final route handler is called
- Be sure to put middleware at the top of your server.js file, so that other routes don't handle the request and send the response before the middleware can be executed
- Most of the time, you won't write your own middleware, but a lot of plugins and extended functionality of express exist as middleware

## Create a static files folder for CSS/JS

- CSS/JS code doesn't change with server-side data
- We can toss any static files into a 'public' directory
    - static means unchanging
    - dynamic means changing depending on data

Let's set up a directory for our static code:

1. Create a directory called `public`
1. Inside the `public` directory create a directory called `css`
1. Inside the `css` directory, create an `app.css` file
1. Put some CSS in the `app.css` file
1. Inside server.js place the following near the top:

    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public')); //tells express to try to match requests with files in the directory called 'public'
    ```

1. In your html, you can now call that css file

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">    
    ```
