# cURL

## Lesson Objectives

1. Describe what cURL is
1. Describe when we might use cURL
1. Use cURL to test a GET request
1. Use cURL to test a POST request
1. Pass parameters to the server using cURL

## Describe what cURL is

- Is a command line tool that acts like a browser
- You can use it to make requests to a website
- All it does is take the response and writes it to the terminal
    - no formatting

## Describe when we might use cURL

- You want to create a route and test that it works
    - with a GET request, you can just type the route into the URL bar in the browser and see if it works
- In order to test routes like POST:
    - you can't just make the request in the browser by entering the path in the URL bar like you would with a GET request
        - doing that always makes a GET request
    - the only way to test a POST request in the browser is via forms
        - you have to write a bunch of code that will lead you up to the point where the POST request is made:
            1. create a /new route
            1. create a new.ejs file with forms
            1. have the forms point to the correct POST route
            1. go to the /new route in the browser
            1. fill out the form
            1. click submit
- With cURL, we can make a POST request directly to the server without needing to go through all the set up

## Use cURL to test a GET request

Within the terminal execute the following:

```
curl https://generalassemb.ly
```

## Use cURL to test a POST request

Set up the following route handler in our app:

```javascript
app.post('/products', (req, res)=>{
    console.log('Create route accessed!');
    res.send('This route works');
});
```

To make a POST request, we'll need to add some arguments to the terminal command

```
curl -X POST localhost:3000/products
```

The `-X POST` argument tells curl to make a POST request to the server

## Pass parameters to the server using cURL

Using the above command, the body of the request will be empty

```javascript
app.post('/products', (req, res)=>{
    console.log('Create route accessed!');
    console.log('Req.body is: ', req.body);
    res.send(req.body);
});
```

If we want to send in data we need to do so like this:

```javascript
curl -X POST -d name="bling" localhost:3000/products
```

or

```javascript
curl -X POST -d name="bling" -d price="cash money" localhost:3000/products
```

For each new key/value pair, add a new `-d property="value"` argument
