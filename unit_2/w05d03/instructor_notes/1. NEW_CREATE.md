## Create a new route and page

1. Let's create a page that will allow us to create a new fruit
1. First, we'll need a route for displaying the page in our server.js file **IMPORTANT: put this above your show route, so that the show route doesn't accidentally pick up a /fruits/new request**

    ```javascript
    //put this above your show.ejs file
    app.get('/fruits/new', function(rew, res){
        res.render('new.ejs');
    });
    ```

1. Now lets's create the html for this page in our /views/new.ejs file

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title></title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>New Fruit page</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/fruits/new to see if it works

## Add interactivity to your site with forms

We can use forms to allow the user to enter their own data:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>New Fruit page</h1>
        <!--  NOTE: action will be the route, method will be the HTTP verb-->
        <form action="/fruits" method="POST">
            Name: <input type="text" name="name" /><br/>
            Color: <input type="text" name="color" /><br/>
            Is Ready To Eat: <input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat" /><br/>
            <input type="submit" name="" value="Create Fruit"/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

**NOTE: the form element has an action and a method attribute.  We get these values from our RESTful routes table.  We'll need this info for the next step too.**

## Create a post route

Since the form in the last step tells the browser to create a POST request to /fruits, we'll need to set up a route handler for this kind of request

```javascript
app.post('/fruits', function(req, res){
    res.send('hi');
});
```

## Define middleware

We can have a function execute for all routes:

```javascript
app.use(function(req, res, next){
    console.log('I run for all routes');
    next();
});
```

- This is called 'middleware'
- It runs in the middle of the request response cycle (in the middle)
    - sometime after the request is received, but before the final route handler is called
- Be sure to put middleware at the top of your server.js file, so that other routes don't handle the request and send the response before the middleware can be executed
- Most of the time, you won't write your own middleware, but a lot of plugins and extended functionality of express exist as middleware

## View body of a post request

1. The POST request to our sever has data in it (name, color, readyToEat, etc).
1. We can easily access this data with a middleware package called body-parser

    ```
    npm install body-parser --save
    ```

1. Require the package

    ```javascript
    //near the top of the file
    var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    ```

1. Tell express to use this middleware

    ```javascript
    //near the top, around other app.use() calls
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:false}));
    ```

1. Now inside the POST to /fruits route handler we can do the following:

    ```javascript
    app.post('/fruits', function(req, res){
        console.log(req.body);
        res.send('data received');
    });
    ```

1. Push this data into our fruits array:

    ```javascript
    app.post('/fruits', function(req, res){
        if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ //if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
            req.body.readyToEat = true; //do some data correction
        } else { //if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
            req.body.readyToEat = false; //do some data correction
        }
        fruits.push(req.body);
        console.log(fruits);
        res.send('data received');
    });
    ```

## Redirect the user to another page

- The data has been added to our fruits array
- Let's send the user back to the fruits index page upon completion

```javascript
app.post('/fruits', function(req, res){
    if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ //if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
        req.body.readyToEat = true;
    } else { //if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
        req.body.readyToEat = false;
    }
    fruits.push(req.body);
    res.redirect('/fruits'); //send the user back to /fruits
});
```

Put a link in the index page going to the new page

```html
<nav>
    <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
</nav>
```
