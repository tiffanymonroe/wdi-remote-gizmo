### EXPRESS CREATE: ADD VIEW LAYER TO PRODUCTS APP

* `git pull upstream master` to get the starter code

* `npm install` to install dependencies


### WHAT IS IT?

This is a simple app that sends JSON to the browser.

The JSON is an array of 'products' inside products.js

The routes for **index**, **show**, and **create** have been made.

There is nothing more to be done other than to convert this app into one that has views.


### DIRECTIONS 

**We want to send our user a form so that they can create new products**

#### Leading questions

* Do you need to install ejs?

* Do you need to make a views folder?

* Is there a folder you should put inside the views folder?

* Will you need a route to serve up the form?

* In what file would you put the form?

* Is there a view that the POST route renders? Or should it just continue to redirect?

#### When you have the form working and creating data:

* What other views would we need to make this app complete? Put them in!


A **PRODUCT** has the properties:

* name
* price
* img
