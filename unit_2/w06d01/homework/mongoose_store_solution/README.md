# A solution to the mongoose store hw

## Note
I apologize for the use of arrow functions `()=>{}`


It is roughy the same as `function (){}` 


I learned to do it this way and I got 3/4 done with this solution before I realized that I had coded out my solution with it instead of what you are using in class. I chose to keep it consistent and not flip back and forth between this and the syntax you are used to.

You will (most likely) get a lesson on arrow functions and other ES6 features at the end of the course.
