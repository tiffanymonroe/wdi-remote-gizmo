## Delete


### This morning your going to try to complete the task before we do it together
What you are going to do is create a delete route so our app can delete some fruit follow these steps:
1.  Create a `delete` route in your `server.js` file.  How do I do this? Look at the express docs, look at stackoverflow, look at the other methods. Remember everything is an object, so maybe it has something like a `delete` method.
2.  inside this route you should remove a fruit from our `fruits` array.  Maybe look up `splice`
3.  Next create a form to submit a delete request on the `index.ejs` page for each fruit.  (Does the form have to be inside or outside the loop?)
4.  Forms can't make delete requests on thier own so we need to use a node module.  Look up `method-ovveride npm` the link to npmjs with the documentation of the module has a subsection with a header of `override using a query value` read that, and try to implement it.
5. Test it out
6. Remember to read your errors carefully.  





### Create a Delete Route

Inside our server.js file, add a DELETE route:

```javascript
app.delete('/fruits/:index', (req, res) => {
	fruits.splice(req.params.index, 1); //remove the item from the array
	res.redirect('/fruits');  //redirect back to index route
});
```

### Make the index page send a DELETE request

Inside our `index.ejs` file, add a form with just a delete button.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Fruits index page</h1>
        <ul>
            <% for(let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++){ %>
                <li>
			The <a href="/fruits/<%=i%>"><%=fruits[i].name; %></a> is  <%=fruits[i].color; %>.
			<% if(fruits[i].readyToEat === true){ %>
				It is ready to eat
			<% } else { %>
				It is not ready to eat
			<% } %>
			<!--  ADD DELETE FORM HERE-->
			<form>
				<input type="submit" value="DELETE"/>
			</form>
                </li>
            <% } %>
        </ul>
        <nav>
            <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
        </nav>
    </body>
</html>
```

When we click "DELETE" on our index page (index.ejs), the form needs to make a DELETE request to our DELETE route.

The problem is that forms can't make DELETE requests.  Only POST and GET.  We can fake this, though.  First we need to install an npm package called `method-override`

```
npm install method-override --save
```

Now, in our server.js file, add:

```javascript
//include the method-override package
var methodOverride = require('method-override');
//...
//after app has been defined
//use methodOverride.  We'll be adding a query parameter to our delete form named _method
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
```

Now go back and set up our delete form to send a DELETE request to the appropriate route

```html
<form action="/fruits/<%=i; %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
```

## Update

### Create an edit route

In our `server.js`, create a GET route which will just display an edit form for a single todo item.

```javascript
app.get('/fruits/:index/edit', function(req, res){
	res.render(
		'edit.ejs', //render views/edit.ejs
		{ //pass in an object that contains
			fruit: fruits[req.params.index], //the fruit object
			index: req.params.index //... and its index in the array
		}
	);
});
```

Now create a very basic form for editing in `views/edit.ejs`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Edit Fruit Page</h1>
        <form>
		<!--  NOTE: the form is pre-populated with values for the server-->
		Name: <input type="text" name="name" value="<%=fruit.name%>"/><br/>
		Color: <input type="text" name="color" value="<%=fruit.color%>"/><br/>
		Is Ready To Eat:
		<input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat"
		    <% if(fruit.readyToEat === true){ %>
			checked
		    <% } %>
		/>
		<br/>
		<input type="submit" name="" value="Submit Changes"/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Create a link to the edit route

Inside our `index.ejs` file, add a link to our edit route which passes in the index of that item in the url

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Fruits index page</h1>
        <ul>
            <% for(var i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++){ %>
                <li>
			The <a href="/fruits/<%=i%>"><%=fruits[i].name; %></a> is  <%=fruits[i].color; %>.
			<% if(fruits[i].readyToEat === true){ %>
				It is ready to eat
			<% } else { %>
				It is not ready to eat
			<% } %>
			<form action="/fruits/<%=i; %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
				<input type="submit" value="DELETE"/>
			</form>
			<!-- Add edit link here  -->
			<a href="/fruits/<%=i; %>/edit">Edit</a>
		</li>
            <% } %>
        </ul>
        <nav>
            <a href="/fruits/new">Create a New Fruit</a>
        </nav>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Create an update route

In order to UPDATE, we use the http verb PUT.

Inside server.js add the following:

```javascript
app.put('/fruits/:index', (req, res) => { //:index is the index of our fruits array that we want to change
    if(req.body.readyToEat === 'on'){ //if checked, req.body.readyToEat is set to 'on'
        req.body.readyToEat = true;
    } else { //if not checked, req.body.readyToEat is undefined
        req.body.readyToEat = false;
    }
	fruits[req.params.index] = req.body; //in our fruits array, find the index that is specified in the url (:index).  Set that element to the value of req.body (the input data)
	res.redirect('/fruits'); //redirect to the index page
});
```

### Make the edit page send a PUT request

When we click "Submit Changes" on our edit page (edit.ejs), the form needs to make a PUT request to our update route

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Edit Fruit Page</h1>
	<!--  ADD action attribute to form tag-->
        <form action="/fruits/<%=index%>">
		Name: <input type="text" name="name" value="<%=fruit.name%>"/><br/>
		Color: <input type="text" name="color" value="<%=fruit.color%>"/><br/>
		Is Ready To Eat:
		<input type="checkbox" name="readyToEat"
			<% if(fruit.readyToEat === true){ %>
				checked
			<% } %>
		/>
		<br/>
		<input type="submit" name="" value="Submit Changes"/>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

The problem is that forms can't make PUT requests.  Only POST and GET.  We can fake this, though.  First we need to install an npm package called `method-override`

```
npm install method-override --save
```

Now, in our app.js file, add:

```javascript
//include the method-override package
var methodOverride = require('method-override');
//...
//after app has been defined
//use methodOverride.  We'll be adding a query parameter to our edit form named _method
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
```

Now go back and set up our edit form to send a PUT request

```html
<form action="/fruits/<%=index%>?_method=PUT" method="POST">
```
