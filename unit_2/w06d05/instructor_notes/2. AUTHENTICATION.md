## Explain what bcrypt does

bcrypt is a package that will encrypt passwords so that if your database gets hacked, people's passwords won't be exposed

## Include bcrypt package

Standard install

```
npm install bcrypt --save
```

and require

```javascript
var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
```

## Hash a string using bcrypt

bcrypt does this thing called "salting" a string.  It requires you to generate a salt which is used in the encryption process.  This must be generated each time you hash a string.  If you don't do this, the same string will get hashed to the same value each time.  If this were to happen, someone with a common password could hack the database and see who else's hashed password had the same value as theirs and know that they have the same password as them.

```javascript
var hashedString = bcrypt.hashSync('yourStringHere', bcrypt.genSaltSync(10));
```

## Compare a string to a hashed value to see if they are the same

Because the same string gets encrypted differently every time, we have no way of actually seeing what the value of the string is.  We can compare it to another string and see if the two are "mathematically" equivalent.

```javascript
bcrypt.compareSync('yourGuessHere', hashedString); //returns true or false
```
